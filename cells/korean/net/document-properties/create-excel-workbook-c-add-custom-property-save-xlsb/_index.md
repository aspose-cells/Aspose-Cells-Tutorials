# Excel 워크북 C# 만들기 – 사용자 지정 속성 추가 및 XLSB 저장

Need to **create Excel workbook C#** and embed some custom metadata? In this guide we’ll walk through adding a custom property, **save workbook as XLSB**, and later **retrieve the custom property value**—all with concise, ready‑to‑run code.  

If you’ve ever wondered why a spreadsheet would need extra data that isn’t visible in the cells, you’re in the right place. Think of custom properties as hidden notes that travel with the file, perfect for linking a workbook to a project ID, version tag, or any business key.

## What You’ll Learn

- How to instantiate a new workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET.  
- The exact steps to **add custom property excel** style, using the `CustomProperties` collection.  
- Saving the workbook in the compact binary XLSB format.  
- Loading the file again and pulling the stored property back out.  

No external configuration files, no obscure tricks—just straight C# that you can paste into a console app and watch it work. The only prerequisite is a reference to the Aspose.Cells library (free trial or licensed version).  

Why care? Because embedding IDs directly in the file eliminates the need for a separate database lookup when you open the workbook later. It’s a tiny habit that can save hours of debugging in large‑scale reporting solutions.

*Image shows a minimal C# console project that creates an Excel workbook, adds a custom property, and saves it as XLSB.*

## Step 1: Initialize the Workbook & Add a Custom Property

The very first thing you need is a fresh `Workbook` object. Once you have it, the `Worksheets[0].CustomProperties` collection gives you a clean place to store key/value pairs.

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

namespace ExcelCustomPropDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Step 1 – Create a new workbook instance
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

            // Step 2 – Add a custom property named "ProjectId" with a numeric value
            // This is the "add custom property excel" part of the tutorial.
            workbook.Worksheets[0].CustomProperties.Add("ProjectId", 12345);
```

**Why this matters:**  
- `Workbook()` creates an in‑memory representation of an Excel file, no disk I/O yet.  
- Adding the property to the *first* worksheet (index 0) ensures it’s stored at the workbook level, making it accessible no matter which sheet the user views.  

> **Pro tip:** Custom properties can hold strings, numbers, dates, or even Boolean values. Choose the type that best matches the data you intend to store.

## Step 2: Save the Workbook as XLSB

XLSB (Excel Binary Workbook) is a compact, fast‑loading format—great for large data sets. The `Save` method takes a file path and a `SaveFormat` enum.

```csharp
            // Step 3 – Save the workbook to disk in XLSB format
            string outputPath = @"C:\Temp\CustomProp.xlsb";
            workbook.Save(outputPath, SaveFormat.Xlsb);

            // At this point the file on disk already contains the custom property.
```

**Why use XLSB?**  
- It reduces file size by up to 70 % compared to the classic XLSX.  
- Binary storage speeds up both write and read operations, which is handy for server‑side automation.

## Step 3: Load the Saved Workbook and Retrieve the Property

Now we flip the scenario: open the file we just wrote and pull the hidden value back out. This demonstrates that the property survived the round‑trip.

```csharp
            // Step 4 – Load the workbook we just saved
            Workbook loadedWorkbook = new Workbook(outputPath);

            // Step 5 – Retrieve the value of the "ProjectId" custom property
            object projectIdValue = loadedWorkbook.Worksheets[0]
                                                .CustomProperties["ProjectId"]
                                                .Value;

            // Display the retrieved value
            System.Console.WriteLine($"Retrieved ProjectId: {projectIdValue}");
        }
    }
}
```

**What you should see:**  
```
Retrieved ProjectId: 12345
```

If the property name is misspelled or doesn’t exist, the `CustomProperties` indexer throws a `KeyNotFoundException`. A defensive approach would be:

```csharp
if (loadedWorkbook.Worksheets[0].CustomProperties.Contains("ProjectId"))
{
    // safe to read
}
```

## Full Working Example (All Steps Combined)

Below is the complete program, ready to copy‑paste into a new console project. No extra scaffolding required.

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;

namespace ExcelCustomPropDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // 1️⃣ Create a new workbook
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

            // 2️⃣ Add a custom property named "ProjectId" (add custom property excel)
            workbook.Worksheets[0].CustomProperties.Add("ProjectId", 12345);

            // 3️⃣ Save the workbook as XLSB (save workbook as xlsb)
            string filePath = @"C:\Temp\CustomProp.xlsb";
            workbook.Save(filePath, SaveFormat.Xlsb);

            // 4️⃣ Load the saved workbook back into memory
            Workbook loaded = new Workbook(filePath);

            // 5️⃣ Retrieve the custom property value (retrieve custom property value)
            object retrieved = loaded.Worksheets[0].CustomProperties["ProjectId"].Value;
            Console.WriteLine($"Retrieved ProjectId: {retrieved}");
        }
    }
}
```

Run the program, open `C:\Temp\CustomProp.xlsb` in Excel, and you’ll notice nothing unusual on the surface—because custom properties are hidden by design. Yet the data lives there, ready for any downstream process.

## Edge Cases & Variations

| Situation | What to Adjust |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Multiple worksheets** | Add the property to any sheet; it will be replicated at the workbook level. |
| **String property** | `CustomProperties.Add("Status", "Approved")` – works the same way. |
| **Missing property** | Use `Contains` before indexing to avoid exceptions. |
| **Large numeric IDs** | Store them as `long` or `string` to prevent overflow. |
| **Cross‑platform** | Aspose.Cells works on .NET Core, .NET Framework, and even Mono, so the same code runs on Linux containers. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this work with the free Aspose.Cells trial?**  
A: Yes. The trial fully supports `CustomProperties` and XLSB saving; just remember the watermark on the output file.

**Q: Can I view custom properties inside Excel?**  
A: In Excel, go to *File → Info → Properties → Advanced Properties → Custom*. Your “ProjectId” will be listed there.

**Q: What if I need to delete a property?**  
A: Call `CustomProperties.Remove("ProjectId")` before saving.

## Wrap‑Up

You now know how to **create Excel workbook C#**, embed a custom property, **save workbook as XLSB**, and later **retrieve the custom property value**. The whole flow fits into a single method, making it a piece of cake to integrate into larger reporting pipelines or document‑generation services.

### What’s Next?

- Explore **adding multiple custom properties** for versioning, author, or department codes.  
- Combine this technique with **cell‑level data** to build self‑describing reports.  
- Look into **reading custom properties** from existing third‑party XLSX files—Aspose.Cells handles those too.

Feel free to tweak the example, swap the numeric ID for a GUID, or experiment with different file formats. The API is straightforward; the real power comes from how you use the hidden metadata in your business logic.

Happy coding! 🚀
