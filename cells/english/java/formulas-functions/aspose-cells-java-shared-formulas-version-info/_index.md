Ready to dive into these features? Let's start by setting up our environment.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher installed on your system.
- **Maven** or **Gradle**: For dependency management and project building.
- **IDE**: Such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and running Java code.

### Required Libraries

To use Aspose.Cells for Java, you'll need to include it in your project. Here’s how to add the library using Maven and Gradle:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```

### License Acquisition

Aspose offers a free trial license, which you can obtain to test the full capabilities of their products. For long-term use, consider purchasing a license or applying for a temporary one.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for Java

Firstly, make sure your environment is properly configured with Aspose.Cells for Java. Once you’ve added the dependency, let's initialize our project:

1. **Project Structure**: Create a new Java project in your IDE and include the Aspose.Cells JAR file or use Maven/Gradle to manage dependencies.
2. **Initialization**: Import necessary classes from the `com.aspose.cells` package.

## Implementation Guide

### Display Aspose.Cells Version

**Overview**
Displaying the current version of Aspose.Cells can be helpful for debugging and ensuring compatibility with your Java application.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Import Libraries**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.*;
   ```
2. **Retrieve and Print Version Information**
   Create a class `DisplayAsposeCellsVersion` to display the version:
   ```java
   public class DisplayAsposeCellsVersion {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           // Retrieve and print the current version of Aspose.Cells for Java.
           String version = CellsHelper.getVersion();
           System.out.println("Aspose.Cells Version: " + version);
       }
   }
   ```

### Create Workbook with Maximum Rows Setting for Shared Formulas

**Overview**
This feature demonstrates how to set a limit on the maximum number of rows that can share a formula, ensuring efficient memory usage and performance.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Define Output Directory**
   ```java
   String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   ```
2. **Create Workbook and Set Max Rows for Shared Formulas**
   In `SetMaxRowsOfSharedFormula` class:
   ```java
   public class SetMaxRowsOfSharedFormula {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           Workbook wb = new Workbook();
           // Limit shared formula rows to 5
           wb.getSettings().setMaxRowsOfSharedFormula(5);
       }
   }
   ```

### Access Worksheet and Cell, Apply Shared Formula with Limitation

**Overview**
Learn how to apply a shared formula across multiple rows while respecting the previously set row limit.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Access Worksheet and Cell**
2. **Apply Shared Formula**
   In `ApplySharedFormulaWithLimit` class:
   ```java
   public class ApplySharedFormulaWithLimit {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
           Workbook wb = new Workbook();
           Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
           Cell cell = ws.getCells().get("D1");
           
           // Apply shared formula, with a maximum of 5 rows sharing
           cell.setSharedFormula("=Sum(A1:A2)", 100, 1); 
       }
   }
   ```

### Save Workbook to Specified Directory

**Overview**
Learn how to save your workbook in a specified directory, which is crucial for file management and distribution.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Save the Workbook**
   In `SaveWorkbook` class:
   ```java
   public class SaveWorkbook {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
           Workbook wb = new Workbook();
           
           // Save to specified path with a defined filename
           wb.save(outDir + "/outputSpecifyMaximumRowsOfSharedFormula.xlsx");
       }
   }
   ```
