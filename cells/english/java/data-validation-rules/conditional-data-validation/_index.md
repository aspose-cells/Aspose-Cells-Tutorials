# Conditional Data Validation


## Introduction to Aspose.Cells for Java

Before we dive into the details of conditional data validation, let's briefly introduce Aspose.Cells for Java. Aspose.Cells is a powerful Java library that allows developers to create, manipulate, and manage Excel spreadsheets without the need for Microsoft Excel. It provides a wide range of features for working with Excel files, including data validation.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Cells for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/java/).

## Step 1: Create a New Java Project

To begin, let's create a new Java project where we will implement conditional data validation. You can use your favorite Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this. Here are the steps:

1. Open your IDE.
2. Create a new Java project.
3. Set up the project with the necessary dependencies, including the Aspose.Cells for Java library.

## Step 2: Import Aspose.Cells for Java

In your Java project, you need to import the Aspose.Cells for Java library to access its features. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;
```

## Step 3: Create an Excel Workbook

Next, let's create an Excel workbook where we will apply conditional data validation. You can create a new workbook using the following code:

```java
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
```

## Step 4: Define Validation Criteria

Conditional data validation involves setting criteria for data in specific cells. For example, you may want to restrict the input in a cell to be a number between 1 and 100. Here's how you can define such criteria:

```java
DataValidation dataValidation = worksheet.getValidations().addDataValidation("A1:A10", DataValidationType.WHOLE, DataValidationOperator.BETWEEN, "1", "100");
```

In this example, we are applying data validation to cells A1 to A10, specifying that the data should be a whole number between 1 and 100.

## Step 5: Set Validation Message and Error Alert

You can provide a validation message and error alert to guide users when they enter data that doesn't meet the criteria. Here's how you can do it:

```java
dataValidation.setErrorMessage("Please enter a number between 1 and 100.");
dataValidation.setErrorTitle("Invalid Input");
dataValidation.setShowError(true);
```

## Step 6: Apply Validation to Cells

Now that you have defined the validation criteria, apply it to the desired cells:

```java
worksheet.getCells().get("A1").setValue(50); // Valid input
worksheet.getCells().get("A2").setValue(150); // Invalid input
```

## Step 7: Save the Workbook

Finally, save the workbook to see the conditional data validation in action:

```java
workbook.save("ConditionalValidationExample.xlsx");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to implement conditional data validation using Aspose.Cells for Java. By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that the data entered into your Excel spreadsheets meets specific criteria, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of your data.
