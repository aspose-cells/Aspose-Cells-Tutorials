# Creating Custom Data Validation


## Introduction

Data validation helps maintain data integrity by preventing users from entering incorrect or invalid data into Excel spreadsheets. While Excel offers built-in data validation options, there are scenarios where you need to define custom validation rules. Aspose.Cells for Java empowers you to achieve this efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.Cells for Java: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/java/).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Java Project

To get started, create a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Add the Aspose.Cells for Java library to your project's classpath.

## Step 2: Creating an Excel Workbook

Let's begin by creating a new Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells for Java.

```java
// Java code to create a new Excel workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

## Step 3: Adding a Worksheet

Now, let's add a worksheet to the workbook where we'll apply our custom data validation.

```java
// Java code to add a worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
```

## Step 4: Defining Custom Validation Criteria

In this step, we'll define the custom validation criteria that our data must adhere to. Let's say we want to restrict the age entered in a cell to be between 18 and 60.

```java
// Java code to define custom validation criteria
Validation validation = worksheet.getValidations().add();
validation.setType(ValidationType.WHOLE);
validation.setOperator(OperatorType.BETWEEN);
validation.setFormula1("18");
validation.setFormula2("60");
validation.setShowError(true);
validation.setAlertStyle(ValidationAlertType.STOP);
validation.setErrorTitle("Invalid Age");
validation.setErrorMessage("Age must be between 18 and 60.");
```

## Step 5: Applying Data Validation to a Range

Now that we've defined our custom validation criteria, let's apply it to a specific range of cells.

```java
// Java code to apply data validation to a range
CellArea area = new CellArea();
area.startRow = 0;
area.startColumn = 0;
area.endRow = 9; // Apply validation to the first ten rows
area.endColumn = 0;

validation.addArea(area);
```

## Step 6: Saving the Excel File

Finally, save the Excel file with the custom data validation rules applied.

```java
// Java code to save the Excel file
workbook.save("CustomDataValidation.xlsx");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to create custom data validation rules using Aspose.Cells for Java. By following these steps, you can ensure that your Excel data adheres to specific criteria, enhancing data integrity and accuracy.
