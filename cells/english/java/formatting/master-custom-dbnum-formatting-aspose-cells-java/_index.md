- Saving formatted data into PDF files
- Applying best practices for performance optimization

Let's dive into the prerequisites you need before getting started!

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Versions
To use Aspose.Cells for Java, include it in your project dependencies. Here’s how:

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```

### Environment Setup
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for managing your project.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with Maven/Gradle will be helpful to follow this tutorial effectively.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for Java
Setting up Aspose.Cells is straightforward. Here’s what you need to do:
1. **Add Dependency**: Ensure the Aspose.Cells library is included in your project, as shown above.
2. **License Acquisition**: You can get a free trial or purchase a license. Visit [Aspose's website](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) for more details on acquiring a temporary or permanent license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
To start using Aspose.Cells, initialize the library in your project:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
### Overview of Custom Decimal Number Formatting
Custom Decimal Number formatting allows you to control how numbers are displayed in your application, following Excel's number format. This feature is crucial for applications requiring precise data representation.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Create a Workbook and Access Worksheet**
First, create an instance of the `Workbook` class and access its first worksheet:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
import com.aspose.cells.Worksheet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Initialize workbook
        Workbook wb = new Workbook();
        
        // Access first worksheet
        Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
    }
}
```
**2. Insert and Format a Value**
Insert a value into cell A1 and apply custom Decimal Number formatting:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Cell;
import com.aspose.cells.Style;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Previous code...

        // Access cell A1 and put value 123
        Cell cell = ws.getCells().get("A1");
        cell.putValue(123);

        // Apply custom Decimal Number formatting
        Style st = cell.getStyle();
        st.setCustom("[DBNum2][$-804]General");

        // Set the formatted style to the cell
        cell.setStyle(st);
    }
}
```
**3. Save Workbook as PDF**
Finally, save your workbook in PDF format:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.SaveFormat;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Previous code...

        // Set column width and save the workbook
        ws.getCells().setColumnWidth(0, 30);
        wb.save("outputDecimalNumberFormatting.pdf", SaveFormat.PDF);

        System.out.println("Custom Decimal Number Formatting Done Successfully");
    }
}
```
**Troubleshooting Tips**
- Ensure the Aspose.Cells library is correctly added to your project.
- Check for any syntax errors in formatting strings.

## Practical Applications
Aspose.Cells enables various practical applications:
1. **Financial Reporting**: Customize numeric formats for financial documents, ensuring compliance with accounting standards.
2. **Data Analytics**: Apply precise number formatting for data visualization and reporting.
3. **ERP Systems**: Enhance ERP systems by integrating custom numeric displays to improve user interfaces.
