# Mastering Data Presentation in Excel: Applying Number and Custom Date Formats with Aspose.Cells for Java

## Introduction

In the realm of data analysis, presenting information clearly is as crucial as gathering it. Imagine you've compiled a spreadsheet full of numbers and dates, but they're presented in plain text form. To communicate effectively with stakeholders or derive meaningful insights, consistent formatting is essential. This tutorial will guide you through using Aspose.Cells for Java to apply number formats and custom date styles to your Excel sheets seamlessly.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to format numbers and dates using Aspose.Cells for Java

## Implementation Guide

### Applying Number Format to a Row

#### Overview

This section demonstrates how to apply a number format to an entire row in your Excel sheet using Aspose.Cells. The example below formats numbers with commas and two decimal places (e.g., 1,234.56).

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

**1. Instantiate Workbook Object**
```java
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
Create a new `Workbook` instance to start working on an Excel file.

**2. Access Worksheet**
```java
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
```
Obtain the reference to the first (default) worksheet.

**3. Create and Configure Style**
```java
Style style = workbook.createStyle();
style.setNumber(4); // Sets number format as #,##0.00

StyleFlag flag = new StyleFlag();
flag.setNumberFormat(true);
```
Initialize a `Style` object and set its number format property.

**4. Apply Style to Row**
```java
worksheet.getCells().getRows().get(0).applyStyle(style, flag);
```
Apply the configured style to the first row of the worksheet.

**5. Save Workbook**
```java
String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
workbook.save(outDir + "/SDisplayFormat_out.xlsx");
```
Save the workbook with the applied styles.

### Applying Custom Date Format to a Column

#### Overview

This section illustrates how to apply a custom date format (e.g., 12-Jan-23) to an entire column, enhancing readability for date-related data.

**Step-by-Step Implementation**

**1. Reuse Workbook and Worksheet Instances**
Ensure the `Workbook` and `Worksheet` instances are already set up from the previous section.

**2. Create and Configure Style**
```java
Style style = workbook.createStyle();
style.setCustom("d-mmm-yy");

StyleFlag flag = new StyleFlag();
flag.setNumberFormat(true);
```
Configure a `Style` object with a custom date format.

**3. Apply Style to Column**
```java
worksheet.getCells().getColumns().get(0).applyStyle(style, flag);
```
Apply the style to the first column of your worksheet.

### Practical Applications

1. **Financial Reports:** Format currency and percentage values for clarity.
2. **Project Management:** Display deadlines in a consistent date format across all project sheets.
3. **Inventory Tracking:** Use number formats to represent stock quantities accurately.

### Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Memory Usage:** Reuse `Style` objects when possible instead of creating new ones for every cell or row.
- **Batch Processing:** Apply styles in bulk (e.g., rows, columns) rather than individually to enhance performance.
- **Efficient Data Structures:** Use appropriate data structures to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to apply number and custom date formats using Aspose.Cells for Java. These techniques will help you present data more effectively in your Excel reports. Explore further functionalities of the library to unlock even more potential in your data manipulation tasks.
