String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your directory path.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "/Book1.xls");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Workbook Initialization

Load an existing Excel file and set up a `Workbook` object:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY"; // Ensure this path is correct.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "/Book1.xls");
```

### Style Creation and Management

Create and manage styles within the Excel file:

**Retrieve Cells Collection:**
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Cells;
import com.aspose.cells.Style;

Cells cells = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0).getCells();
```

**Create and Apply Style:**
```java
Style styleObject = workbook.createStyle();
cells.get("A1").setStyle(styleObject);
cells.get("A2").setStyle(styleObject);
```

### Font Styling in a Style Object

Customize font properties such as color:

**Set Font Color:**
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Font;
import com.aspose.cells.Color;

Font font = styleObject.getFont();
font.setColor(Color.getRed()); // Change font color to red.
```
