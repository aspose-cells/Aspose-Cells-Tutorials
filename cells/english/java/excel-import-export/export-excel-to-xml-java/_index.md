# Export Excel to XML Java


In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of exporting Excel data to XML using Aspose.Cells for Java. With detailed explanations and source code examples, you'll master this essential task in no time.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Cells for Java library, which you can download [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/java/).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

1. Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE.
2. Add the Aspose.Cells for Java library to your project's dependencies.

## Step 2: Loading the Excel File

To export Excel data to XML, we first need to load the Excel file.

```java
// Load the Excel file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook("path_to_your_excel_file.xlsx");
```

## Step 3: Accessing the Worksheet

Next, we need to access the worksheet from which we want to export data.

```java
// Access the worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0); // Change the index as needed
```

## Step 4: Exporting to XML

Now, let's export the worksheet data to XML.

```java
// Create a Stream to hold the XML data
ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

// Export the worksheet data to XML
worksheet.save(outputStream, SaveFormat.XML);
```

## Step 5: Saving the XML File

You can save the XML data to a file if needed.

```java
// Save the XML data to a file
try (FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.xml")) {
    outputStream.writeTo(fileOutputStream);
}
```

## Step 6: Complete Code Example

Here's the complete code example for exporting Excel to XML in Java with Aspose.Cells:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class ExcelToXMLExporter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Load the Excel file
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook("path_to_your_excel_file.xlsx");

            // Access the worksheet
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0); // Change the index as needed

            // Create a Stream to hold the XML data
            ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

            // Export the worksheet data to XML
            worksheet.save(outputStream, SaveFormat.XML);

            // Save the XML data to a file
            try (FileOutputStream fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.xml")) {
                outputStream.writeTo(fileOutputStream);
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
