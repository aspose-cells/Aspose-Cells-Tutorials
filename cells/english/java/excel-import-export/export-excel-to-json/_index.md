# Export Excel to JSON


In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of exporting Excel data to JSON format using the Aspose.Cells for Java library. This step-by-step guide will provide you with source code examples to help you effortlessly convert your Excel files into JSON data.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.Cells for Java: Download and install the Aspose.Cells for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/java/).
- Excel File: Prepare the Excel file that you want to convert to JSON.

## Step 1: Import Aspose.Cells for Java
First, you need to import the Aspose.Cells library into your Java project. Add the following line to your Java code:

```java

```

## Step 2: Load the Excel File
Next, load the Excel file you want to export to JSON. You can use the following code snippet to achieve this:

```java
// Load the Excel file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook("your_excel_file.xlsx");
```

Replace `"your_excel_file.xlsx"` with the path to your Excel file.

## Step 3: Convert to JSON
Now, let's convert the Excel data to JSON format. Use the following code to perform the conversion:

```java
// Initialize JsonSaveOptions
JsonSaveOptions jsonSaveOptions = new JsonSaveOptions();

// Save the workbook as JSON
workbook.save("output.json", jsonSaveOptions);
```

This code will save the Excel data as a JSON file named "output.json" in your project directory.
