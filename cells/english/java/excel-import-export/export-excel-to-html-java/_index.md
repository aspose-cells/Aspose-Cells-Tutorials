# Export Excel to HTML Java

In today's tutorial, we will delve into the process of exporting Excel files to HTML format using the Aspose.Cells for Java API. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the entire process, from setting up your development environment to writing the code and generating HTML files from Excel spreadsheets. So, let's dive right in!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

## 1. Java Development Environment

Ensure you have a Java development environment set up on your system. You can download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from the Oracle website.

## 2. Aspose.Cells for Java Library

You'll need to download and include the Aspose.Cells for Java library in your project. You can obtain the library from the Aspose website or add it as a Maven dependency.

## Step 1: Create a Java Project

Start by creating a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or simply use a text editor and command-line tools.

## Step 2: Add Aspose.Cells Library

Add the Aspose.Cells for Java library to your project's classpath. If you're using Maven, include the library in your `pom.xml` file.

## Step 3: Load Excel File

In this step, you'll load the Excel file that you want to export to HTML. You can do this by creating a `Workbook` object and loading the Excel file using its path.

```java
// Load the Excel file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook("path_to_your_excel_file.xlsx");
```

## Step 4: Convert to HTML

Now, let's convert the Excel file to HTML format. Aspose.Cells provides a simple method for this:

```java
// Save the workbook as HTML
workbook.save("output.html", SaveFormat.HTML);
```

## Step 5: Run Your Application

Compile and run your Java application. Once the code is executed successfully, you will find the HTML file named "output.html" in your project directory.

## Conclusion
