# CSV Export Java Code



In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to export data to CSV format using the powerful Aspose.Cells for Java library. Whether you're working on a data-driven project or need to generate CSV files from your Java application, Aspose.Cells provides a simple and efficient solution. Let's dive into the process.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Cells for Java: Download and include the Aspose.Cells for Java library in your project. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/java/).

## Creating a Java Project

1. Open your favorite Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or use a text editor of your choice.
2. Create a new Java project or open an existing one.

## Adding Aspose.Cells Library

To add Aspose.Cells for Java to your project, follow these steps:

1. Download the Aspose.Cells for Java library from the website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/java/).
2. Include the downloaded JAR file in your project's classpath.

## Writing the CSV Export Code

Now, let's write the Java code to export data to a CSV file using Aspose.Cells. Here's a simple example:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;
import java.io.*;

public class CsvExportExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Load the Excel workbook
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook("input.xlsx");

        // Access the worksheet
        Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

        // Specify the CSV options
        CsvSaveOptions options = new CsvSaveOptions();
        options.setSeparator(',');

        // Save the worksheet as a CSV file
        worksheet.save("output.csv", options);

        System.out.println("Data exported to CSV successfully.");
    }
}
```

In this code, we load an Excel workbook, specify the CSV options (such as the separator), and then save the worksheet as a CSV file.

## Running the Code

Compile and run the Java code in your IDE. Ensure that you have an Excel file named "input.xlsx" in your project directory. After running the code, you'll find the exported CSV file as "output.csv" in the same directory.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've learned how to export data to CSV format using Aspose.Cells for Java. This versatile library simplifies the process of working with Excel files in Java applications.
