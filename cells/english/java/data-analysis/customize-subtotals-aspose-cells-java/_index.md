## Implementation Guide

### Customizing Total Names with Aspose.Cells

#### Overview
In this section, we will customize subtotal and grand total names in Excel reports using Aspose.Cells for Java. This feature is essential for creating multilingual financial documents.

#### Implementing Subtotal Name Customization
1. **Create a Custom Class**
   Extend the `GlobalizationSettings` class to override methods that return custom total names:
   ```java
   package AsposeCellsExamples.TechnicalArticles;

   import com.aspose.cells.GlobalizationSettings;

   public class GlobalizationSettingsImp extends GlobalizationSettings {
       // Return customized subtotal name
       @Override
       public String getTotalName(int functionType) {
           return "Chinese Total - 可能的用法";
       }

       // Return customized grand total name
       @Override
       public String getGrandTotalName(int functionType) {
           return "Chinese Grand Total - 可能的用法";
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Set the Globalization Settings**
   Apply your custom globalization settings to your application:
   ```java
   // Set the instance of your custom class
   GlobalizationSettings.setInstance(new GlobalizationSettingsImp());
   ```

#### Explanation
- `getTotalName(int functionType)`: Returns a customized name for subtotals.
- `getGrandTotalName(int functionType)`: Provides a custom name for grand totals.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: If the names don't appear as expected, verify that your class correctly extends `GlobalizationSettings`.
- **Debugging Tip**: Use print statements within methods to ensure they are called correctly.

## Practical Applications
1. **Financial Reporting**: Customize total names in global financial reports for different regions.
2. **Inventory Management**: Localize inventory summaries in multinational companies.
3. **Sales Data Analysis**: Provide localized insights by customizing totals in sales dashboards.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Ensure your application efficiently uses memory when handling large datasets with Aspose.Cells.
- **Java Memory Management Best Practices**:
  - Use try-with-resources to manage workbook instances.
  - Regularly clear unused objects from the heap.
