Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**

Include this in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```

### License Acquisition Steps

Aspose.Cells offers a free trial to test its features:
- **Free Trial**: Download the library from [Aspose Downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/java/) and explore its capabilities.
- **Temporary License**: For extended testing without evaluation limitations, request a temporary license at [Aspose Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: Unlock full features for production use by purchasing a license from the [Aspose Purchase Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

After obtaining your license file, set it up in your Java application:
```java
License license = new License();
license.setLicense("path/to/your/aspose.cells.lic");
```

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Start by creating a `Workbook` object to represent an Excel file:
```java
// Load an existing workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook("path/to/existing/file.xls");

// Create a new workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to manipulate text box controls in Excel using Aspose.Cells for Java.

### Extracting Text from TextBoxes

**Overview**: Read the current content of any text boxes within your worksheet.

#### Step 1: Load Your Workbook
Load an existing workbook that contains text boxes:
```java
Workbook workbook = new Workbook("path/to/your/excel/file.xls");
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0); // Access the first sheet
```

#### Step 2: Access Text Boxes
Retrieve and iterate through all text boxes to extract their content:
```java
// Get all text boxes in the first worksheet
Collection<TextBox> textBoxes = worksheet.getTextBoxes();

for (TextBox textbox : textBoxes) {
    String text = textbox.getText();
    System.out.println("Text: " + text);
}
```

### Modifying TextBox Content

**Overview**: Modify the content of a specific text box.

#### Step 1: Access the Desired Text Box
Access and modify the text in your desired text box:
```java
TextBox textbox = worksheet.getTextBoxes().get(1); // Access the second text box (index 1)
String existingText = textbox.getText();
System.out.println("Existing Text: " + existingText);
```

#### Step 2: Update the Text Box Content
Change the content of the text box:
```java
textbox.setText("This is an alternative text");
```

### Saving Your Changes

After making modifications, save the workbook to persist changes.
```java
workbook.save("path/to/your/output/file.xls");
```
