```

## Implementation Guide
This section covers how to add and style text boxes in an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for Java.

### Adding a TextBox to a Worksheet
#### Overview
Adding a text box allows you to place custom text anywhere on your Excel sheet, making it useful for headers or annotations.
#### Steps:
**1. Create Workbook and Access Worksheet**
```java
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
```
**2. Add the Text Box**
Use `add()` method to insert a text box at your desired location.
```java
int textboxIndex = worksheet.getTextBoxes().add(2, 1, 160, 200); // x, y, width, height
TextBox textbox0 = worksheet.getTextBoxes().get(textboxIndex);
textbox0.setText("ASPOSE______The .NET & JAVA Component Publisher!");
```
**3. Set Placement**
Configure the text box placement type.
```java
textbox0.setPlacement(com.aspose.cells.PlacementType.FREE_FLOATING);
```
**4. Save the Workbook**
Finally, save your workbook to persist changes.
```java
workbook.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/AddingTextBoxControl_out1.xls");
```
### Configuring TextBox Appearance and Hyperlink
#### Overview
Enhance the visual appeal of your text box by configuring fonts, colors, and adding hyperlinks.
#### Steps:
**1. Configure Font Properties**
Customize font style to make it visually appealing.
```java
textbox0.getFont().setColor(Color.getBlue());
textbox0.getFont().setBold(true);
textbox0.getFont().setSize(14);
textbox0.getFont().setItalic(true);
```
**2. Add a Hyperlink**
Incorporate hyperlinks for interactive content.
```java
textbox0.addHyperlink("http://www.aspose.com/");
```
**3. Set Fill Color and Gradient Style**
Enhance the text box background using gradients.
```java
FillFormat fillformat = textbox0.getFill();
fillformat.setOneColorGradient(Color.getSilver(), 1, GradientStyleType.HORIZONTAL, 1);
```
**4. Configure Line Format**
Define the border style of the text box for better aesthetics.
```java
LineFormat lineformat = textbox0.getLine();
lineformat.setDashStyle(MsoLineStyle.THIN_THICK);
lineformat.setWeight(6);
lineformat.setDashStyle(MsoLineDashStyle.SQUARE_DOT);
```
**5. Save Changes**
Save your workbook with the updated styling.
```java
workbook.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/AddingTextBoxControl_out2.xls");
```
### Adding and Configuring a Second TextBox
#### Overview
Add multiple text boxes to enhance information presentation.
#### Steps:
**1. Add Another Text Box**
Position and size it as needed using different methods.
```java
TextBox textbox1 = (com.aspose.cells.TextBox)worksheet.getShapes().addShape(
    MsoDrawingType.TEXT_BOX, 15, 0, 4, 0, 85, 120);
textbox1.setText("This is another simple text box");
```
**2. Set Placement Type**
Determine how the new text box will behave with sheet resizing.
```java
textbox1.setPlacement(com.aspose.cells.PlacementType.MOVE_AND_SIZE);
```
**3. Save Workbook**
Persist all changes to your Excel file.
```java
workbook.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/AddingTextBoxControl_out3.xls");
```
