    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a new workbook instance to start working with Excel files.
        Workbook wb = new Workbook();
        
        // Save or modify the file as required using Aspose.Cells methods.
        wb.save("output.xlsx");
    }
}
```
## Implementation Guide
### Adding WordArt Text in Java
#### Overview
In this section, we'll guide you through adding various styles of WordArt text to an Excel worksheet using the Aspose.Cells library.

#### Step-by-Step Guide
##### Accessing the Workbook and Worksheet
Firstly, create a new workbook instance and access its first worksheet:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
import com.aspose.cells.Worksheet;

// Create a new workbook object
Workbook wb = new Workbook();

// Access the first worksheet in the workbook
Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
```
##### Adding WordArt Text
Now, let's add WordArt using built-in styles. Each style can be applied by specifying its index:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.PresetWordArtStyle;
import com.aspose.cells.ShapeCollection;

// Access the shapes collection of the worksheet
ShapeCollection shapes = ws.getShapes();

// Add various WordArt styles
shapes.addWordArt(PresetWordArtStyle.WORD_ART_STYLE_1, "Aspose File Format APIs", 0, 0, 0, 0, 100, 800);
shapes.addWordArt(PresetWordArtStyle.WORD_ART_STYLE_2, "Aspose File Format APIs", 10, 0, 0, 0, 100, 800);
shapes.addWordArt(PresetWordArtStyle.WORD_ART_STYLE_3, "Aspose File Format APIs", 20, 0, 0, 0, 100, 800);
shapes.addWordArt(PresetWordArtStyle.WORD_ART_STYLE_4, "Aspose File Format APIs", 30, 0, 0, 0, 100, 800);
shapes.addWordArt(PresetWordArtStyle.WORD_ART_STYLE_5, "Aspose File Format APIs", 40, 0, 0, 0, 100, 800);
```
##### Parameters Explained
- **PresetWordArtStyle:** Determines the style of WordArt.
- **Text:** The content to be displayed as WordArt.
- **X and Y Positioning:** Coordinates for positioning WordArt on the worksheet.

#### Saving the Workbook
Finally, save your workbook with all modifications:
```java
import java.io.File;

// Define the directory path where you want to save your file
String dataDir = "path/to/your/directory/";

// Save the workbook in xlsx format
wb.save(dataDir + "AddWordArtText_out.xlsx");
```
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Shape Overlap:** Adjust X and Y coordinates if shapes overlap.
- **File Path Issues:** Ensure your directory path is correct to avoid file not found errors.

## Practical Applications
Aspose.Cells with WordArt capabilities can be applied in various real-world scenarios, such as:
1. **Marketing Presentations:** Enhance presentations for marketing pitches with visually striking headers.
