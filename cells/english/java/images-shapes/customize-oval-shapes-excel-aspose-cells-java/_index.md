# Add and Customize Oval Shapes in Excel Using Aspose.Cells Java

## Introduction

Enhance your Excel spreadsheets by adding visually appealing oval shapes directly through code using Aspose.Cells for Java. This tutorial will guide you through the process of incorporating custom ovals into an Excel workbook, perfect for data visualization, creating interactive reports, or making documents stand out.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to add and customize oval shapes in Excel with Aspose.Cells for Java.
- Techniques for modifying fill and line formats.
- Performance optimization tips for large spreadsheets.
- Real-world applications of these skills.

Let's set up your environment and start implementing these features!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Aspose.Cells for Java Library:** Add this library as a dependency using Maven or Gradle.
- **Java Development Environment:** JDK installed on your system and an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse configured.
- **Basic Understanding of Java:** Familiarity with object-oriented programming in Java is beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for Java

### Installation

Include the Aspose.Cells library in your project:

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```

### License Acquisition
Aspose.Cells can be used for free with some limitations:
- **Free Trial:** Test features in a limited capacity.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain an extended evaluation period from Aspose's website.
- **Purchase License:** For full functionality without restrictions.

### Basic Initialization
Create an instance of the `Workbook` class to start using Aspose.Cells:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

public class InitializeAspose {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Adding an Oval Shape

#### Overview
This section demonstrates how to add a customizable oval shape to your Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells.

##### Step 1: Instantiate a Workbook
Create a `Workbook` object:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

Workbook excelbook = new Workbook();
```

##### Step 2: Add an Oval Shape
Add the oval shape to the first worksheet at specified coordinates and dimensions:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Oval;
import com.aspose.cells.MsoDrawingType;

Oval oval1 = (Oval) excelbook.getWorksheets().get(0).getShapes().addShape(MsoDrawingType.OVAL, 2, 2, 0, 0, 130, 130);
```
**Explanation:** 
- `MsoDrawingType.OVAL` specifies the shape type.
- `(2, 2)` defines the starting position on the worksheet (measured in Excel cells).
- The next two zeros are placeholders for X and Y offsets within a cell.
- `130, 130` sets the width and height of the oval.

##### Step 3: Customize Fill Format
Set a gradient fill to enhance visual appeal:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Color;
import com.aspose.cells.FillFormat;
import com.aspose.cells.GradientStyleType;

FillFormat fillformat = oval1.getFill();
fillformat.setOneColorGradient(Color.getNavy(), 1, GradientStyleType.HORIZONTAL, 1);
```
**Explanation:** 
- `Color.getNavy()` gives the color for the gradient.
- `GradientStyleType.HORIZONTAL` applies a horizontal gradient effect.

##### Step 4: Set Line Format
Customize the border of your oval:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.LineFormat;
import com.aspose.cells.MsoLineStyle;

LineFormat lineformat = oval1.getLine();
lineformat.setDashStyle(MsoLineStyle.SINGLE);
lineformat.setWeight(1);
lineformat.setOneColorGradient(Color.getGreen(), 1, GradientStyleType.HORIZONTAL, 1);
```
**Explanation:** 
- `MsoLineStyle.SINGLE` indicates a solid line.
- Adjusting the weight and gradient can enhance visibility.

##### Step 5: Save the Workbook
Save your workbook to an output directory:
```java
excelbook.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/AddingAnOvalShape_out.xls");
```

#### Adding a Second Oval Shape
Follow similar steps to add another oval with different properties, demonstrating Aspose.Cells' flexibility for customization.

### Practical Applications
1. **Data Visualization:** Use ovals to highlight key data points in dashboards.
2. **Interactive Reports:** Enhance reports with clickable shapes linked to other sheets or web resources.
3. **Educational Tools:** Create engaging worksheets that include visual aids for students.
4. **Business Presentations:** Add branded elements like logos as oval shapes in presentations.

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Memory Usage:** Manage large datasets efficiently by disposing of unnecessary objects.
- **Batch Processing:** Process multiple shapes in batches to reduce memory overhead.
- **Efficient Resource Management:** Use Aspose.Cells' built-in methods for resource cleanup after operations.
