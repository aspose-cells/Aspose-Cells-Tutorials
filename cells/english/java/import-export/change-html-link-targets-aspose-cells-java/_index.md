```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle Installation

In your `build.gradle`, include the following line:

```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-cells:25.3'
```

### License Acquisition Steps

Aspose.Cells requires a license for full functionality, but you can start with a free trial or request a temporary license:

import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
import com.aspose.cells.HtmlSaveOptions;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Initialize a Workbook object with an Excel file path
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook("path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx");
        
        // Set up HtmlSaveOptions for exporting to HTML format
        HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions();
        // Configure additional options as needed
        
        // Save the document in HTML format
        workbook.save("output/path/outputFile.html", options);
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down how you can change HTML link targets using Aspose.Cells for Java.

### Overview of Changing Link Targets

When exporting Excel files to HTML, hyperlinks can be set to open in the same window or a new tab. This feature is crucial for controlling user navigation and enhancing SEO.

#### Step 1: Setting Up Your Workbook

Start by loading your Excel file into an Aspose.Cells `Workbook` object:

```java
String dataDir = "your/data/directory/";
String inputPath = dataDir + "Sample1.xlsx";
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(inputPath);
```

#### Step 2: Configuring HTML Save Options

Use the `HtmlSaveOptions` class to specify how hyperlinks should behave in your exported HTML document:

```java
// Import HtmlLinkTargetType for setting link targets
import com.aspose.cells.HtmlLinkTargetType;

HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
opts.setLinkTargetType(HtmlLinkTargetType.SELF);  // Links open in the same window/tab
```

#### Step 3: Saving the Workbook as HTML

Finally, save your workbook with the configured options:

```java
String outputPath = dataDir + "CHLinkTarget.html";
workbook.save(outputPath, opts);

System.out.println("File saved at " + outputPath);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issue:** Links not updating as expected. Ensure `HtmlSaveOptions` is correctly configured and applied during the save process.
- **Performance Concerns:** For large files, consider optimizing your code to handle memory efficiently.

## Practical Applications

Understanding how to manipulate hyperlink targets can be beneficial in several scenarios:

1. **SEO Optimization:** Ensuring links open within the same tab can improve user engagement metrics.
2. **User Experience Enhancement:** Control over navigation helps tailor a more coherent browsing experience.
3. **Integration with Web Portals:** When integrating Excel data into web applications, controlling link behavior is crucial.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure your application runs smoothly:

- **Memory Management:** Regularly monitor resource usage when dealing with large Excel files.
- **Optimization Tips:** Use efficient data structures and avoid unnecessary computations to enhance performance.
