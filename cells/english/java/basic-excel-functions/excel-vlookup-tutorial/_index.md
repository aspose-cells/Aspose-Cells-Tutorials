Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);

// Set the lookup value
String lookupValue = "John";

// Specify the table range for VLOOKUP
String tableRange = "A1:B5";

// Define the column index for the result
int columnIndex = 2;

// Perform the VLOOKUP
Cell cell = worksheet.getCells().find(lookupValue, null, tableRange, 0, columnIndex);
```

## Handling the Result

Now that we have performed the VLOOKUP, let's handle the result.

```java
if (cell != null) {
    // Get the value from the cell
    String result = cell.getStringValue();

    // Print the result
    System.out.println("VLOOKUP Result: " + result);
} else {
    System.out.println("Value not found.");
}
```
