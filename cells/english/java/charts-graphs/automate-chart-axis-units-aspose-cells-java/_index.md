## Implementation Guide

### Loading and Accessing Data

Start by loading the Excel file containing your data. This step is crucial for accessing and manipulating charts within the workbook:
```java
// Load the sample Excel file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(srcDir + "sampleHandleAutomaticUnitsOfChartAxisLikeMicrosoftExcel.xlsx");

// Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);

// Access first chart
Chart ch = ws.getCharts().get(0);
```

### Automating Chart Axis Units

Automating chart axis units ensures that your charts mimic the behavior of Excel, providing consistency and accuracy in data representation.

**Render Chart to PDF:**
Exporting charts to different formats can be particularly useful for presentations or reports. Here's how you render a chart to PDF:
```java
// Render chart to pdf
ch.toPdf(outDir + "outputHandleAutomaticUnitsOfChartAxisLikeMicrosoftExcel.pdf");
```

### Key Configuration Options
