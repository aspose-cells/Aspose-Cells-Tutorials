# Creating and Formatting Excel Charts with Aspose.Cells for Java

## Introduction

Managing complex data in Excel files can be challenging, but tools like Aspose.Cells for Java make it simpler. This powerful library allows you to read, write, and manipulate spreadsheets effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through creating and formatting charts using Aspose.Cells for Java, ensuring your data presentations are both accurate and visually appealing.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Display the version of Aspose.Cells for Java.
- Load and access Excel files.
- Add series to charts and set format codes.
- Save modified Excel files efficiently.

Let's start by setting up your environment and implementing these features.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher is recommended.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
- **Aspose.Cells for Java**: We'll use version 25.3 of this library.

### Environment Setup Requirements

Make sure your IDE is configured with the JDK and that you have a basic understanding of Java programming. Familiarity with Excel file structures will also be beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for Java

To start using Aspose.Cells for Java, include it in your project using Maven or Gradle:

### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```

#### License Acquisition

You can acquire a free trial license or purchase a full license to unlock all features of Aspose.Cells for Java. Visit the [purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) for more details on licensing options.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once you have added the dependency, initialize Aspose.Cells in your project:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class InitializeAsposeCells {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Set license if available
        License license = new License();
        license.setLicense("path_to_your_license.lic");

        // Display the version of Aspose.Cells for Java being used.
        System.out.println("Aspose.Cells for Java Version: " + CellsHelper.getVersion());
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Display Aspose.Cells Version

This feature helps you verify which version of Aspose.Cells is in use, ensuring compatibility and access to the latest features.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class DisplayAsposeCellsVersion {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Output the version of Aspose.Cells for Java being used.
        System.out.println("Aspose.Cells for Java Version: " + CellsHelper.getVersion());
    }
}
```

### Load and Access Excel File

Loading an Excel file is straightforward with Aspose.Cells. Here’s how you can access a specific worksheet:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class LoadAndAccessExcelFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Define data directory with your path.
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";

        // Load the source Excel file from the specified directory.
        Workbook wb = new Workbook(dataDir + "/sampleSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx");

        // Access the first worksheet in the workbook.
        Worksheet worksheet = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
    }
}
```

### Access and Add Series to Chart

Adding series to a chart is essential for data visualization. Here’s how you can do it:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class AccessAndAddSeriesToChart {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Define data directory with your path.
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";

        // Load the Excel file.
        Workbook wb = new Workbook(dataDir + "/sampleSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx");

        // Access the first worksheet.
        Worksheet worksheet = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);

        // Access the first chart in the worksheet.
        Chart ch = worksheet.getCharts().get(0);

        // Add series to the chart using an array of values.
        ch.getNSeries().add("{10000, 20000, 30000, 40000}", true);
    }
}
```

### Set Values Format Code for Chart Series

Formatting chart data is crucial for readability. Here’s how you can set a currency format:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class SetValuesFormatCodeForChartSeries {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Define data directory with your path.
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";

        // Load the Excel file.
        Workbook wb = new Workbook(dataDir + "/sampleSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx");

        // Access the first worksheet.
        Worksheet worksheet = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);

        // Access the first chart in the worksheet.
        Chart ch = worksheet.getCharts().get(0);

        // Access the series and set its values format code to currency format.
        Series srs = ch.getNSeries().get(0);
        srs.setValuesFormatCode("$#,##0");
    }
}
```

### Save Excel File

After making changes, save your workbook to preserve the updates:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class SaveExcelFile {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Define output directory with your path.
        String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

        // Load the Excel file.
        Workbook wb = new Workbook("YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY/sampleSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx");

        // Save the workbook to the specified output directory.
        wb.save(outDir + "/outputSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx");
    }
}
```
