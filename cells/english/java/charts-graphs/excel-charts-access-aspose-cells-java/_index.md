    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle Setup:**
Add this line to your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```

### License Acquisition Steps
Aspose.Cells offers different licensing options, including a free trial license and temporary licenses for evaluation purposes. Here's how you can acquire one:

license.setLicense("path_to_your_license.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load an Excel File
**Overview:** Loading an Excel file is the initial step in manipulating its data with Aspose.Cells.

#### Step 1: Create a Workbook Object
Create a `Workbook` object to represent your entire Excel workbook:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "sample.xlsx");
```

### Access Worksheet
**Overview:** Accessing the right worksheet is crucial for extracting relevant data.

#### Step 2: Retrieve a Specific Worksheet
Retrieve the first worksheet using:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Worksheet;

Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
// System.out.println("Sheet Name: " + worksheet.getName());
```

### Access Chart in Worksheet
**Overview:** Accessing charts allows you to perform visual data analysis.

#### Step 3: Retrieve a Chart from the Worksheet
Obtain the first chart present within your selected worksheet:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Chart;

Chart chart = worksheet.getCharts().get(0);
// System.out.println("Chart's Sheet Name: " + chart.getWorksheet().getName());
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** Ensure the path to `sample.xlsx` is correct and accessible.
