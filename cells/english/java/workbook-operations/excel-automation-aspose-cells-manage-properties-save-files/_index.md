            license.setLicense("path/to/your/license/file.lic");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("License setup failed: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Retrieve Aspose.Cells Version
#### Overview
Knowing the version of your library can be crucial for debugging and ensuring compatibility with features.

##### Step 1: Import Required Packages

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Version;
import com.aspose.cells.CellsHelper;
```

##### Step 2: Get the Library Version
Use `CellsHelper.getVersion()` to retrieve the current Aspose.Cells version:

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";
Version asposeCellsVersion = CellsHelper.getVersion();
System.out.println("Aspose.Cells Version: " + asposeCellsVersion);
```

### Create Workbook and Access Built-in Document Properties
#### Overview
Accessing built-in properties like author or title helps in managing metadata efficiently.

##### Step 1: Initialize Workbook

```java
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

##### Step 2: Access Document Properties

```java
BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection bdpc = wb.getBuiltInDocumentProperties();

// Example: Set the Author property
bdpc.setAuthor("John Doe");
System.out.println("Author set to: " + bdpc.getAuthor());
```

### Set Language Property in Excel File
#### Overview
Defining language settings ensures your document meets regional standards.

##### Step 1: Initialize Workbook and Document Properties

```java
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection bdpc = wb.getBuiltInDocumentProperties();
```

##### Step 2: Define Languages
Set the languages using the `setLanguage` method:

```java
bdpc.setLanguage("German, French");
System.out.println("Languages set to: " + bdpc.getLanguage());
```

### Save Workbook in XLSX Format
#### Overview
Saving your workbook in a specific format is essential for compatibility and distribution.

##### Step 1: Create a New Workbook

```java
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

##### Step 2: Save the Workbook
Specify the output directory and save format:

```java
String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
wb.save(outDir + "/output.xlsx", SaveFormat.XLSX);
System.out.println("Workbook saved at: " + outDir);
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Automated Reports**: Generate customized reports with predefined properties for consistency.
2. **Multi-language Documentation**: Set language preferences to cater to global audiences.
3. **Version Control**: Track and log Aspose.Cells versions in your build scripts.

These features can be integrated into larger systems, such as content management platforms or enterprise reporting tools.
