public class ExcelVersionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook("path_to_your_file.xlsx");
        // Your operations here...
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's implement the feature to retrieve the version number of various Excel files using Aspose.Cells.

### Get Excel File Version (Excel 2003)
#### Overview
This section demonstrates retrieving the version from an Excel 2003 file (.xls).

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**
1. **Load the Workbook:** Load your .xls file into a `Workbook` object.

    ```java
    String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";
    Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "Excel2003.xls");
    ```
2. **Print Version Number:** Use built-in document properties to get the version number and print it.

    ```java
    System.out.println("Excel 2003 XLS Version: " + workbook.getBuiltInDocumentProperties().getVersion());
    ```

### Get Excel File Version (Excel 2007)
#### Overview
