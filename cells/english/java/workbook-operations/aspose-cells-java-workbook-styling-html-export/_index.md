In the world of software development, managing Excel files programmatically can be a complex task. Whether you're generating reports or handling data analytics, having the right tools is crucial. Enter **Aspose.Cells for Java**—a powerful library designed to simplify Excel file manipulation in Java applications. This tutorial will guide you through retrieving version information, styling workbooks, and exporting worksheets as HTML with CSS styles separated. By the end of this guide, you'll have a firm grasp on these features, empowering you to integrate sophisticated Excel functionalities into your Java projects.

## What You'll Learn
- How to retrieve Aspose.Cells for Java version information.
- Techniques for creating and styling workbooks in Java.
- Methods for exporting worksheets as HTML with separate CSS styles.
Let's dive into the prerequisites and get started!

## Prerequisites
Before embarking on this journey, ensure you have a solid foundation in the following areas:
- **Java Development Environment**: Make sure you have JDK installed and configured. An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse will be beneficial.
- **Aspose.Cells for Java Library**: Download and set up Aspose.Cells library using Maven or Gradle.
- **Basic Knowledge of Excel Manipulation**: Familiarity with Excel operations in Java can enhance your understanding.

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
To integrate Aspose.Cells into your project, you need to add the following dependencies:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```

### License Acquisition
To fully utilize Aspose.Cells, you'll need a license. You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license for evaluation purposes. For long-term use, purchasing a license is necessary.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for Java
Begin by setting up your development environment:
1. **Install the Library**: Add the Maven or Gradle dependency to your project.
2. **Acquire a License**: Visit [Aspose's Purchase Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) to obtain a temporary or full license.
3. **Initialize Aspose.Cells**: In your Java application, initialize Aspose.Cells by adding licensing code if you have a license file.

Here’s how you can set up the basic environment:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.License;

public class InitializeAspose {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Set license for Aspose.Cells
        License license = new License();
        license.setLicense("path/to/your/license/file.lic");
        
        System.out.println("Aspose.Cells for Java is ready to use!");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Now that you've set up your environment, let's explore how to implement the key features.

### Feature 1: Version Information Retrieval
**Overview**: Retrieve and display the version of Aspose.Cells for Java. This can be useful for logging or ensuring compatibility.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
**Retrieve Version**
```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class VersionInfo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Retrieve and print the version information
        String version = CellsHelper.getVersion();
        System.out.println("Aspose.Cells for Java Version: " + version);
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: 
- `CellsHelper.getVersion()` fetches the current library version.
- This feature is straightforward but crucial for debugging and compatibility checks.

### Feature 2: Workbook Creation and Cell Styling
**Overview**: Learn how to create a workbook, access worksheets, modify cell content, and apply styling such as changing font color.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
**Create Workbook and Access Worksheet**
```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class WorkbookAndCellStyling {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create an instance of the Workbook object
        Workbook wb = new Workbook();
        
        // Access the first worksheet in the workbook
        Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
```
**Modify Cell Content and Style**
```java
        // Retrieve cell B5 from the worksheet
        Cell cell = ws.getCells().get("B5");
        
        // Set value "This is some text." to cell B5
        cell.putValue("This is some text.");
        
        // Get the style of the cell, set font color to red
        Style st = cell.getStyle();
        st.getFont().setColor(Color.getRed());
        
        // Apply the styled settings back to the cell
        cell.setStyle(st);
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: 
- `Workbook` and `Worksheet` objects are used to manipulate Excel files.
- Cell styling is achieved using the `Style` class, allowing customization like font color.

### Feature 3: Export Worksheet CSS Separately in HTML
**Overview**: Export an Excel worksheet as an HTML file with styles (CSS) separated. This feature enhances the visual presentation of your data on web platforms.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
**Create Workbook and Style Cell**
```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class ExportWorksheetCSSSeparatelyInHTML {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a Workbook object
        Workbook wb = new Workbook();
        
        // Access the first worksheet in the workbook
        Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
        
        // Access cell B5 and put value inside it
        Cell cell = ws.getCells().get("B5");
        cell.putValue("This is some text.");
        
        // Set the style of the cell - font color to red
        Style st = cell.getStyle();
        st.getFont().setColor(Color.getRed());
        
        // Apply the styled settings back to the cell
        cell.setStyle(st);
```
**Export as HTML with Separate CSS**
```java
        // Specify HTML save options with CSS exported separately
        HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
        opts.setExportWorksheetCSSSeparately(true);
        
        // Save the workbook as an HTML file with specified options
        String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
        wb.save(outDir + "/outputExportWorksheetCSSSeparately.html", opts);
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: 
- `HtmlSaveOptions` allows customization of how Excel files are saved as HTML.
- Setting `setExportWorksheetCSSSeparately(true)` ensures CSS is exported separately for better styling control.

## Practical Applications
Aspose.Cells for Java isn't just about basic file manipulation; it offers extensive capabilities for real-world applications:
1. **Automated Reporting**: Generate dynamic reports with styled Excel files and export them as HTML for web viewing.
2. **Data Analysis**: Manipulate large datasets, apply styles, and present data in a visually appealing format.
3. **Integration with Web Applications**: Seamlessly integrate Excel functionalities into Java-based web applications, enhancing user experience.

## Performance Considerations
