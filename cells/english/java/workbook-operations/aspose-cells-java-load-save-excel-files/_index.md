```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle Setup

In your `build.gradle`, include this line:

```gradle
compile group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3'
```

### License Acquisition

You can obtain a free trial license to explore Aspose.Cells features without limitations for 30 days. For longer-term usage, consider purchasing a subscription or applying for a temporary license.

**Basic Initialization:**

Once you've included the library in your project, initialize it as follows:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

public class ExcelHandler {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook("path/to/your/excel/file.xlsx");
        // Perform operations on the workbook here
    }
}
```

With Aspose.Cells set up, let's delve into how to implement its features for loading and saving Excel files.

## Implementation Guide

### Loading and Saving Excel Files with Aspose.Cells

This feature allows you to load an existing Excel file, perform various manipulations, and save the results back to a new or updated Excel file.

#### Load an Excel File

**Overview:**
Loading an Excel file is straightforward using Aspose.Cells. You only need to specify the path of your Excel document.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

public class LoadExcel {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Load the source Excel file
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "/sampleSortData_CustomSortList.xlsx");
        
        System.out.println("Excel file loaded successfully.");
    }
}
```

#### Save an Excel File

**Overview:**
After performing your desired operations, you can save the changes to a specified location.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

public class SaveExcel {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";
        String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Load the source Excel file
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "/sampleSortData_CustomSortList.xlsx");
        
        // Save the modified Excel file
        workbook.save(outDir + "/outputSortData_CustomSortList.xlsx");
        
        System.out.println("Excel file saved successfully.");
    }
}
```

### Accessing Worksheet and Specifying Cell Area

This feature enables you to target specific worksheets and define cell areas for operations, improving efficiency by limiting processing to necessary sections.

#### Access a Specific Worksheet

**Overview:**
Accessing a worksheet allows focused manipulation of its data. Hereâ€™s how you can access the first worksheet in your workbook:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
import com.aspose.cells.Worksheet;

public class AccessWorksheet {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Load the source Excel file
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "/sampleSortData_CustomSortList.xlsx");
        
        // Access first worksheet
        Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
        
        System.out.println("Worksheet accessed successfully.");
    }
}
```

#### Specify Cell Area

**Overview:**
Defining a specific cell area allows precise operations on a subset of cells, such as sorting or formatting.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.CellArea;
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
import com.aspose.cells.Worksheet;

public class DefineCellArea {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";
        
        // Load the source Excel file
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "/sampleSortData_CustomSortList.xlsx");
        
        // Access first worksheet
        Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
        
        // Specify cell area - sort from A1 to A40
        CellArea ca = CellArea.createCellArea("A1", "A40");
        
        System.out.println("Cell area defined successfully.");
    }
}
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
- Verify that the specified worksheet index exists in your Excel document.
