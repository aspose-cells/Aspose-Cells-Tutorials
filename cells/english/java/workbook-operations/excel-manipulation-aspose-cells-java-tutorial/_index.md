Ready to dive in? Let's get started with setting up your environment.

## Prerequisites (H2)

Before we begin, ensure you have the following in place:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine. We recommend using JDK 8 or higher.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for writing and running Java code.
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for Java (H2)

To use Aspose.Cells in your project, you need to include it as a dependency. Here's how you can do this using Maven and Gradle:

**Maven**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```

### License Acquisition

Aspose.Cells operates under a licensing model, but you can get started with a free trial license to evaluate its features. Visit the [Aspose website](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for details on obtaining a temporary or purchased license.

Once your setup is ready, let's move into implementing Aspose.Cells functionalities.

## Implementation Guide

### Workbook Instantiation and Worksheet Access (H2)

#### Overview
Creating an Excel workbook and accessing its worksheets are fundamental tasks when working with spreadsheets. Here’s how you can accomplish these using Aspose.Cells for Java:

##### Step 1: Instantiate a New Workbook

Create a new instance of the `Workbook` class to start your Excel document.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY"; // Define your directory path here
dataDir += "/Data/";

// Create a new workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

##### Step 2: Add and Access Worksheets

You can add new worksheets to your workbook and access them programmatically.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Worksheet;

int sheetIndex = workbook.getWorksheets().add(); // Add a worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(sheetIndex); // Access the added worksheet
```

### Setting Cell Value and Style with Font Underline (H2)

#### Overview
Modifying cell values and applying styles such as font underlining can enhance your spreadsheet's readability. Let’s see how this is done:

##### Step 1: Set a Cell Value

Access specific cells in the worksheet to set their values.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Cells;
import com.aspose.cells.Cell;

Cells cells = worksheet.getCells(); // Get cell collection
cell = cells.get("A1"); // Access the "A1" cell
cell.setValue("Hello Aspose!"); // Set value in the cell
```

##### Step 2: Apply Font Underline Style

Use the `Style` and `Font` classes to modify cell appearance.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Style;
import com.aspose.cells.Font;
import com.aspose.cells.FontUnderlineType;

// Get current style of the cell
Style style = cell.getStyle();
Font font = style.getFont();

// Apply underline style
font.setUnderline(FontUnderlineType.SINGLE);
style.setFont(font);

// Update the cell with new style
cell.setStyle(style);
```

#### Saving Your Workbook

Don't forget to save your changes to a file.

```java
String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Define output directory path here
dataDir += "/SFUnderlineType_out.xls";
workbook.save(dataDir); // Save workbook with changes
```

## Practical Applications (H2)

Here are some practical use cases for these features:
1. **Automated Reporting**: Generate reports dynamically, including styling to highlight key data points.
2. **Data Entry Systems**: Create and modify spreadsheets as part of a larger data entry or management application.
3. **Custom Excel Templates**: Develop custom templates that require specific formatting or data structures.

## Performance Considerations (H2)

When working with Aspose.Cells, keep these performance tips in mind:
- Minimize the number of cell operations by batching updates when possible.
- For large workbooks, consider using streaming APIs to reduce memory usage.
- Dispose of resources properly to avoid memory leaks.

## Conclusion

You’ve now learned how to create Excel workbooks from scratch and apply styles to cells using Aspose.Cells for Java. With these skills, you can automate many aspects of Excel file management in your applications.
