## Implementation Guide

This section will guide you through implementing key features using Aspose.Cells for Java.

### Feature 1: Version Information Retrieval

**Overview:**
Before diving into complex operations, check the version of Aspose.Cells in use. This ensures compatibility and access to all current features.

**Implementation Steps:**

#### Displaying Version Information

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class VersionInfo {
    public static void displayVersion() throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Aspose.Cells for Java Version: " + CellsHelper.getVersion());
    }
}
```

- **Purpose:** This method prints the version of Aspose.Cells, helping verify your environment setup.

### Feature 2: Loading an Excel Workbook

**Overview:**
Loading a workbook is the first step in manipulating or exporting its contents. Here's how to load an Excel file from a specified directory.

#### Loading Excel File

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class LoadWorkbook {
    public static void loadExcelFile(String dataDir) throws Exception {
        String filePath = dataDir + "sampleExportDocumentWorkbookAndWorksheetPropertiesInHTML.xlsx";
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook(filePath);
    }
}
```

- **Parameters:** `dataDir` specifies the directory containing your Excel file.
- **Purpose:** Creates a `Workbook` object for further manipulation or saving.

### Feature 3: Configuring HTML Save Options

**Overview:**
Customizing how your Excel files are exported to HTML is crucial for maintaining specific properties and formatting.

#### Configuring HTML Save Options

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class HtmlSaveOptionsConfig {
    public static void configureHtmlSaveOptions(HtmlSaveOptions options) {
        options.setExportDocumentProperties(false);
        options.setExportWorkbookProperties(false);
        options.setExportWorksheetProperties(false);
    }
}
```

- **Purpose:** This configuration prevents the export of document, workbook, and worksheet properties to HTML.

### Feature 4: Saving Workbook as HTML

**Overview:**
Finally, save your Excel workbook as an HTML file using configured options.

#### Exporting Workbook as HTML

```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class SaveAsHtml {
    public static void exportToHtml(Workbook workbook, String outDir) throws Exception {
        HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions();
        configureHtmlSaveOptions(options);
        
        String outputPath = outDir + "outputExportDocumentWorkbookAndWorksheetPropertiesInHTML.html";
        workbook.save(outputPath, options);
    }

    private static void configureHtmlSaveOptions(HtmlSaveOptions options) {
        options.setExportDocumentProperties(false);
        options.setExportWorkbookProperties(false);
        options.setExportWorksheetProperties(false);
    }
}
```

- **Purpose:** Saves the Excel file in HTML format with specified configurations.
