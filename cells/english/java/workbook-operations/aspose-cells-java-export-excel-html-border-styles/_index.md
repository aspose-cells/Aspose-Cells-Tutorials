## Introduction

Maintaining consistent styling when exporting Excel files to HTML can be challenging. With Aspose.Cells for Java, you can effortlessly manage complex Excel formatting and ensure similar border styles are preserved in your HTML exports. This tutorial will guide you through the steps needed to leverage Aspose.Cells for Java to achieve this functionality.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Retrieve and display the version of Aspose.Cells for Java.
- Load an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells.
- Configure HtmlSaveOptions to export similar border styles.
- Save an Excel workbook as an HTML file with specific save options.

Let's dive into how you can set up your environment and implement these features. Before we start, ensure you have everything ready for this journey.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
To follow along, add the Aspose.Cells library to your project using either Maven or Gradle:

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-cells:25.3'
```

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure you have Java installed and configured on your system, as Aspose.Cells for Java is a library that runs on the JVM.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of Java programming and familiarity with working with Excel files programmatically will be beneficial.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for Java

### Installation Information
To get started with Aspose.Cells for Java, install it using Maven or Gradle as shown above. Make sure your project is set up to include these dependencies.

### License Acquisition Steps
Aspose offers a free trial license that allows you to test the full capabilities of their libraries without limitations. You can acquire this by visiting [Aspose's Free Trial Page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/java/). For longer-term use, consider purchasing a subscription or obtaining a temporary license via [Aspose's Purchase and Temporary License Pages](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once you have the library set up in your project, initialize it with:
```java
// Set Aspose.Cells license (if available)
License license = new License();
license.setLicense("Path_to_your_license_file.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

We will now walk through implementing key features using Aspose.Cells for Java.

### Feature 1: Version Display

**Overview:**
Retrieve and display the version of your installed Aspose.Cells for Java library to ensure compatibility with other code snippets.

#### Retrieve Aspose.Cells Version
```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class VersionDisplay {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Get and print the version information
        String versionInfo = CellsHelper.getVersion();
        System.out.println("Aspose.Cells for Java Version: " + versionInfo);
    }
}
```
*This code snippet demonstrates how to call `CellsHelper.getVersion()` to fetch version details.*

### Feature 2: Workbook Loading

**Overview:**
Learn how to load an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells, which is the first step before any processing or export.

#### Load an Excel Workbook
```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class LoadWorkbook {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Define the file path for your Excel file
        String filePath = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY/sampleExportSimilarBorderStyle.xlsx";
        
        // Create a new workbook instance from the specified file
        Workbook wb = new Workbook(filePath);
    }
}
```
*Using `Workbook` constructor, you can load existing Excel files into memory.*

### Feature 3: HTML Save Options Configuration

**Overview:**
Configure save options specifically for exporting similar border styles when converting to HTML.

#### Configure HtmlSaveOptions
```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class ConfigureHtmlSaveOptions {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Instantiate HtmlSaveOptions with specific settings
        HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
        
        // Enable exporting of similar border styles
        opts.setExportSimilarBorderStyle(true);
    }
}
```
*The `setExportSimilarBorderStyle(true)` ensures consistent styling in exported HTML.*

### Feature 4: Workbook Saving as HTML

**Overview:**
Finally, save your loaded workbook as an HTML file with the configured options.

#### Save Workbook as HTML
```java
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class SaveWorkbookAsHtml {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Load the Excel file
        Workbook wb = new Workbook("YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY/sampleExportSimilarBorderStyle.xlsx");
        
        // Configure save options for HTML export
        HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
        opts.setExportSimilarBorderStyle(true);
        
        // Define output path for the saved HTML file
        String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/outputExportSimilarBorderStyle.html";
        
        // Save the workbook as an HTML with specified settings
        wb.save(outputPath, opts);
    }
}
```
*This snippet uses `wb.save()` to export your workbook into a styled HTML format.*
