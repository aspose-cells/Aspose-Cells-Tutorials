    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```

### License Acquisition Steps

2. **Temporary License**: Obtain from the [Aspose site](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase**: For long-term use, consider purchasing a full license at [Aspose Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once you have included Aspose.Cells in your project, initialize it in your Java application:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Initialize a new Workbook object
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
        
        // Load an existing Excel file
        workbook = new Workbook("path_to_your_file.xlsx");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Prevent Exporting Hidden Worksheets

#### Overview
This feature allows you to configure Aspose.Cells so that hidden worksheets are not exported when converting your Excel document to HTML or other formats.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Step 1: Initialize Workbook**
Load the workbook from which you want to exclude hidden sheets during export.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
import AsposeCellsExamples.Utils;

public class PreventExportingHiddenWorksheetContent {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Define the path to your data directory
        String dataDir = Utils.getSharedDataDir(PreventExportingHiddenWorksheetContent.class) + "TechnicalArticles/";
        
        // Create a Workbook object from an existing file
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "source.xlsx");
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Configure Export Options**
Use the `IStreamProvider` to set export options, ensuring hidden worksheets are excluded.

```java
import com.aspose.cells.IStreamProvider;

public class PreventExportingHiddenWorksheetContent {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Initialize export options
        IStreamProvider options = new ImplementingIStreamProvider();
        
        // Set the option to not export hidden worksheets
        options.setExportHiddenWorksheet(false);
    }
}
```

**Step 3: Save Workbook**
Finally, save the workbook to your desired format without exporting hidden sheets.

```java
public class PreventExportingHiddenWorksheetContent {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Save the workbook as HTML with specified options
        workbook.save(dataDir + "PEHWorksheetContent_out.html", options);
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that your `dataDir` path is correctly set to avoid file-not-found errors.
- Check for version compatibility between Aspose.Cells and your JDK.

## Practical Applications

1. **Data Reporting**: Use this feature in data reporting tools where only active data should be exported, enhancing clarity and relevance.
2. **Automated Report Generation**: Integrate with business intelligence systems to generate reports without clutter from hidden sheets.
3. **Custom Dashboard Creation**: Create dashboards that present clean data without unnecessary information.

## Performance Considerations
When dealing with large Excel files or numerous worksheets, consider these optimization tips:
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently manage memory by disposing of unused resources promptly.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files in batches to optimize performance.
- **Java Memory Management**: Use JVM options to allocate sufficient heap space for processing large workbooks.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you've learned how to effectively prevent exporting hidden worksheet content using Aspose.Cells Java. This capability can greatly streamline your Excel file handling processes by ensuring only relevant data is exported.

For further exploration, consider delving into other features of Aspose.Cells such as formula calculation or chart manipulation.
