This guide will empower you to retrieve version information, configure strict Open XML compliance, and add data seamlessly using the powerful Aspose.Cells library. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to Java-based Excel manipulations, this tutorial will equip you with essential skills for effective document management.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Retrieve and display the version of Aspose.Cells for Java.
- Create workbooks compliant with ISO 29500-2008 Strict Open XML Spreadsheet format.
- Add data to cells and save your workbook in desired formats.
- Optimize performance when working with large Excel files.

Let's dive into the prerequisites you'll need to start this exciting journey!
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following requirements met:
1. **Required Libraries**: You'll need Aspose.Cells for Java version 25.3 or later.
2. **Environment Setup**: A development environment capable of running Java applications (e.g., JDK installed).
3. **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with basic Java programming and handling dependencies.
## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for Java
To incorporate Aspose.Cells into your project, you can use popular build automation tools like Maven or Gradle:
**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```
**Gradle:**
```gradle
compile(group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-cells', version: '25.3')
```
### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial**: Begin by downloading a trial to explore Aspose.Cells' capabilities.
- **Temporary License**: Request a temporary license for more extensive testing without limitations.
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, consider purchasing a license.
Initialize the library in your Java application as follows:
```java
// Import necessary packages
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class AsposeSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Basic initialization code if needed
    }
}
```
## Implementation Guide
### Feature 1: Version Information Retrieval
#### Overview
This feature helps you retrieve and display the version of Aspose.Cells for Java, which is crucial for debugging or ensuring compatibility.
**Step-by-Step Guide:**
**Retrieve Version Information**
```java
// Import necessary packages
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class VersionInfo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Get the version of Aspose.Cells for Java.
            String versionInfo = CellsHelper.getVersion();
            
            // Display or use the version information as needed
            System.out.println("Aspose.Cells Version: " + versionInfo);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: This snippet utilizes `CellsHelper.getVersion()` to fetch the library's current version, aiding in maintaining compatibility.
### Feature 2: Workbook Creation and Configuration for Strict Open XML Spreadsheet Format
#### Overview
This feature involves creating a new workbook and configuring it to adhere to ISO 29500-2008 Strict Open XML Spreadsheet standards.
**Step-by-Step Guide:**
**Create and Configure Workbook**
```java
// Import necessary packages
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class StrictWorkbook {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a new instance of Workbook.
            Workbook wb = new Workbook();
            
            // Set workbook compliance to ISO 29500-2008 Strict Open XML Spreadsheet format.
            wb.getSettings().setCompliance(OoxmlCompliance.ISO_29500_2008_STRICT);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: Here, `wb.getSettings().setCompliance()` sets the workbook to comply strictly with Open XML standards.
### Feature 3: Adding Data to a Workbook and Saving
#### Overview
Add data to specific cells in your workbook and save it in the XLSX format using Aspose.Cells for Java.
**Step-by-Step Guide:**
**Add Data and Save Workbook**
```java
// Import necessary packages
import com.aspose.cells.*;

public class AddDataAndSave {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY"; // Set your data directory path
        String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Set your output directory path

        try {
            // Create a new Workbook instance.
            Workbook wb = new Workbook();
            
            // Access the first worksheet (index 0).
            Worksheet sheet = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
            
            // Get cell B4 on the first worksheet.
            Cell cellB4 = sheet.getCells().get("B4");
            
            // Add a message to cell B4.
            cellB4.putValue("This Excel file has Strict Open XML Spreadsheet format.");
            
            // Save the workbook in XLSX format.
            wb.save(outDir + "outputSaveWorkbookToStrictOpenXMLSpreadsheetFormat.xlsx", SaveFormat.XLSX);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation**: This code demonstrates how to manipulate cell data and save your workbook in a specified format.
