### Implementation Guide
Let's break down each feature step-by-step, using Aspose.Cells Java to automate Excel tasks effectively.

#### Instantiating Workbook and Worksheet
**Overview:**
Creating a new workbook and adding worksheets are foundational steps in automating Excel with Java. This section covers how to start from scratch or build on an existing workbook template.

**Step 1:** Import Required Classes
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
import com.aspose.cells.Worksheet;
```

**Step 2:** Create a New Workbook
```java
// Instantiates a new Workbook object, representing an Excel file.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

**Step 3:** Add and Access a Worksheet
```java
// Adds a new worksheet to the workbook and retrieves its reference.
int sheetIndex = workbook.getWorksheets().add();
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(sheetIndex);
```

#### Accessing and Modifying Cell
**Overview:**
Directly access or modify cell contents is crucial for data manipulation. Here, we'll demonstrate setting a value in a specific cell.

**Step 1:** Import the `Cell` Class
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Cell;
```

**Step 2:** Access and Set Value
```java
// Accesses the cell at address "A1" in the newly added worksheet.
Cell cell = worksheet.getCells().get("A1");

// Sets a value to the accessed cell.
cell.setValue("Hello World!");
```

#### Creating Range and Applying Style
**Overview:**
Applying styles can enhance readability and presentation. This feature shows how to create ranges and apply uniform styling across multiple cells.

**Step 1:** Import Necessary Classes
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Range;
import com.aspose.cells.Style;
import com.aspose.cells.BorderType;
import com.aspose.cells.CellBorderType;
import com.aspose.cells.Color;
```

**Step 2:** Create Range and Define Style
```java
// Creates a range of cells from "A1" to "F10".
Range range = worksheet.getCells().createRange("A1:F10");

// Retrieves the style of cell "A1" and modifies its border properties.
Style style = cell.getStyle();
style.setBorder(BorderType.TOP_BORDER, CellBorderType.THICK, Color.getBlack());
style.setBorder(BorderType.BOTTOM_BORDER, CellBorderType.THICK, Color.getBlack());
style.setBorder(BorderType.LEFT_BORDER, CellBorderType.THICK, Color.getBlack());
style.setBorder(BorderType.RIGHT_BORDER, CellBorderType.THICK, Color.getBlack());

// Iterates over each cell in the range and applies the modified style.
for (Object obj : range) {
    if (obj instanceof com.aspose.cells.Cell) {
        com.aspose.cells.Cell temp = (com.aspose.cells.Cell)obj;
        temp.setStyle(style);
    }
}
```

#### Saving Workbook to File
**Overview:**
After making all modifications, saving your workbook is the final step. Here's how you can save it as an Excel file.

**Step 1:** Import Necessary Class
```java
import java.io.IOException;
```

**Step 2:** Save the Workbook
```java
// Placeholder for the directory where output files will be saved.
String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

try {
    // Saves the workbook with all changes made in the specified output directory.
    workbook.save(outDir + "/CCAToROrCArea_out.xls");
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
