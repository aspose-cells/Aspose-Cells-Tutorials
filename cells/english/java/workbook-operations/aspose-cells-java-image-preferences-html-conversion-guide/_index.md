To use Aspose.Cells, add it as a dependency to your project:

**Maven Setup:**
Add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-cells</artifactId>
    <version>25.3</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle Setup:**
Include this line in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle

```java
License license = new License();
license.setLicense("path/to/your/license.lic");
```

With the setup complete, let's explore setting image preferences when converting Excel files to HTML using Aspose.Cells for Java.

## Implementation Guide

### Overview: Setting Image Preferences
Controlling how images are rendered is crucial for maintaining document integrity during conversion. This section guides you through configuring these settings effectively.

#### Step 1: Load Your Workbook
Start by loading your Excel workbook:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
import AsposeCellsExamples.Utils;

public class SettingImagePreferencesForHTML {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // The path to the documents directory.
        String dataDir = Utils.getSharedDataDir(SettingImagePreferencesForHTML.class)
                + "LoadingSavingConvertingAndManaging/";

        // Instantiate a Workbook object by excel file path
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "Book1.xlsx");
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure HTML Save Options
Next, configure the `HtmlSaveOptions` to set image preferences:
```java
import com.aspose.cells.HtmlSaveOptions;

// Create HtmlSaveOptions object
HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions();

// Set options for images
options.setExportImagesAsBase64(true); // Embed images as base64 strings

// Save the document in HTML format with specified options
workbook.save(dataDir + "Output.html", options);
```
**Explanation:**
- `setExportImagesAsBase64(true)`: This setting embeds images directly into the HTML file using Base64 encoding, ensuring they are displayed correctly without needing separate image files.

#### Step 3: Save the Workbook as HTML
Finally, save your workbook with the configured options:
```java
// Save the document in HTML format with specified options
workbook.save(dataDir + "Output.html", options);

System.out.println("PDF Creation Time successfully.");
```
**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure file paths are correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- If images do not appear, check that Base64 encoding is enabled.

## Practical Applications
1. **Business Reporting**: Convert complex Excel reports into web-friendly HTML for easy sharing and viewing.
2. **Data Visualization**: Embed high-quality charts and graphs in web applications without losing visual fidelity.
3. **E-commerce Platforms**: Automatically convert product data sheets to interactive HTML pages.
4. **Educational Content**: Transform educational materials into accessible online formats.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large Excel files, consider these tips for optimal performance:
- **Memory Management**: Use efficient memory management practices in Java to handle large workbooks without running out of resources.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multi-threading where possible to speed up processing time.
- **Resource Cleanup**: Always release resources like workbook objects after use.
