## Creating a Combined Chart

### Step 1: Import the necessary classes and packages from Aspose.Cells for Java into your Java project.

### Step 2: Initialize a Workbook object.

```java
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

### Step 3: Add a worksheet to the workbook.

```java
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
```

### Step 4: Create a combined chart object.

```java
int chartIndex = worksheet.getCharts().add(ChartType.LINE, 0, 0, 20, 10);
Chart chart = worksheet.getCharts().get(chartIndex);
```

## Adding Data to the Chart

Now that we have created a combined chart, let's add some data to it.

### Step 5: Create a data series for the chart.

```java
Cells cells = worksheet.getCells();
chart.getNSeries().add("A1:A5", true);
chart.getNSeries().add("B1:B5", true);
```

### Step 6: Set the category data range for the chart.

```java
chart.getNSeries().setCategoryData("C1:C5");
```

## Customizing the Chart

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the combined chart to meet your specific requirements.

### Step 7: Customize the chart title and axis labels.

```java
chart.getTitle().setText("Combined Chart Example");
chart.getCategoryAxis().getTitle().setText("Categories");
chart.getValueAxis().getTitle().setText("Values");
```

2. Step 8: Adjust the chart's appearance.

```java
chart.getLegend().setPosition(LegendPositionType.BOTTOM);
chart.getLegend().setOverlay(true);
```

## Saving and Exporting the Chart

Once you've created and customized your combined chart, you can save it to an Excel file or export it to various formats.

### Step 9: Save the workbook to an Excel file.

```java
workbook.save("CombinedChart.xlsx");
```

### Step 10: Export the chart to an image file.

```java
chart.toImage("CombinedChart.png", ImageFormat.getPng());
```
