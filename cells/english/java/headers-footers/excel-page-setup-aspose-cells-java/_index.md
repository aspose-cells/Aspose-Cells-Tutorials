    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll explore how to configure various Page Setup options using Aspose.Cells for Java. We’ll break it down by feature.

### Configuring Page Orientation

**Overview:**
Set whether your worksheet prints in portrait or landscape orientation.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Access the Worksheet**
   
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
   import com.aspose.cells.Worksheet;

   // Load the workbook and access the first sheet
   Workbook workbook = new Workbook("CustomerReport.xls");
   Worksheet sheet = workbook.getWorksheets().get(0);
   ```

2. **Set Orientation**
   
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.PageOrientationType;
   import com.aspose.cells.PageSetup;

   PageSetup pageSetup = sheet.getPageSetup();
   // Set orientation to portrait
   pageSetup.setOrientation(PageOrientationType.PORTRAIT);
   ```

### Fit To Pages

**Overview:**
Determine how many pages the worksheet spans across vertically and horizontally.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Fit Vertically and Horizontally**
   
   ```java
   // Span the length of the worksheet over one page tall
   pageSetup.setFitToPagesTall(1);
   
   // Span the width of the worksheet over one page wide
   pageSetup.setFitToPagesWide(1);
   ```

### Paper Size

**Overview:**
Select a specific paper size for printing, such as A4.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Set Paper Size**
   
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.PaperSizeType;

   // Set the paper size to A4
   pageSetup.setPaperSize(PaperSizeType.PAPER_A_4);
   ```

### Print Quality

**Overview:**
Adjust the print quality in dots per inch (DPI).

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Set Print Quality**
   
   ```java
   // Set print quality to 1200 DPI for high-quality prints
   pageSetup.setPrintQuality(1200);
   ```

### First Page Number

**Overview:**
Configure the starting number of the first printed page.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Define Starting Page Number**
   
   ```java
   // Set the first page number to 2
   pageSetup.setFirstPageNumber(2);
   ```
