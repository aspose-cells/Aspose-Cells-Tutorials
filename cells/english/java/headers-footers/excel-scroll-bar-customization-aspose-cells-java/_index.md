        Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "book1.xls");
        
        // Your scroll bar customization code will go here
        
        // Save your changes
        String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
        workbook.save(outDir + "DisplayHideScrollBars_out.xls");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the process of hiding scroll bars in Excel workbooks using Aspose.Cells for Java.

### Load and Modify Workbook Settings
#### Overview
This feature allows you to load an existing Excel workbook and modify its scroll bar visibility, improving readability by controlling navigation elements.

#### Step 1: Instantiate a Workbook Object
Firstly, create a `Workbook` object from the specified file path:

```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";
// Load an existing Excel file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "book1.xls");
```

This step initializes your workbook for further manipulation.

#### Step 2: Hide the Vertical Scroll Bar
To enhance the visual appeal of your spreadsheet, you might want to hide unnecessary scroll bars. Hereâ€™s how to hide the vertical scroll bar:

```java
// Set the visibility of the vertical scroll bar to false
workbook.getSettings().setVScrollBarVisible(false);
```

#### Step 3: Hide the Horizontal Scroll Bar
Similarly, manage horizontal navigation by hiding the horizontal scroll bar:

```java
// Set the visibility of the horizontal scroll bar to false
workbook.getSettings().setHScrollBarVisible(false);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that you have included Aspose.Cells dependencies correctly in your project.
- If issues persist, refer to [Aspose.Cells Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/java/) for detailed guidance.
