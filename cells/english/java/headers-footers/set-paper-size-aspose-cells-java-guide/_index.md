### Feature Implementation Guide

#### Set Paper Size to A2

**Overview**
This feature demonstrates setting your worksheet's paper size to A2 and retrieving its dimensions in inches. Useful for generating reports requiring specific dimensions.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**
1. **Initialize Workbook and Worksheet**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.*;

   public class PaperSizeA2 {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           // Create a new workbook instance
           Workbook wb = new Workbook();

           // Access the first worksheet in the workbook
           Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
   ```
2. **Set the Paper Size**
   ```java
           // Set paper size to A2
           ws.getPageSetup().setPaperSize(PaperSizeType.PAPER_A_2);
   ```
3. **Retrieve and Print Dimensions**
   ```java
           // Retrieve and print the paper width and height in inches
           double paperWidth = ws.getPageSetup().getPaperWidth() / 72; // Convert points to inches
           double paperHeight = ws.getPageSetup().getPaperHeight() / 72;

           System.out.println("A2 Paper Width: " + paperWidth + " inches");
           System.out.println("A2 Paper Height: " + paperHeight + " inches");
       }
   }
   ```
**Parameters & Method Purposes**
- `setPaperSize(PaperSizeType.PAPER_A_2)`: Sets the paper size to A2.
- `getPaperWidth()` and `getPaperHeight()`: Retrieve dimensions in points, convert to inches for display.

#### Set Paper Size to A3

**Overview**
Similar to setting up A2, this feature adjusts your worksheet's paper settings to A3.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**
1. **Initialize Workbook and Worksheet**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.*;

   public class PaperSizeA3 {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           // Create a new workbook instance
           Workbook wb = new Workbook();

           // Access the first worksheet in the workbook
           Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
   ```
2. **Set the Paper Size**
   ```java
           // Set paper size to A3
           ws.getPageSetup().setPaperSize(PaperSizeType.PAPER_A_3);
   ```
3. **Retrieve and Print Dimensions**
   ```java
           // Retrieve and print the paper width and height in inches
           double paperWidth = ws.getPageSetup().getPaperWidth() / 72; // Convert points to inches
           double paperHeight = ws.getPageSetup().getPaperHeight() / 72;

           System.out.println("A3 Paper Width: " + paperWidth + " inches");
           System.out.println("A3 Paper Height: " + paperHeight + " inches");
       }
   }
   ```
#### Set Paper Size to A4

**Overview**
This section covers setting the worksheet's dimensions to A4, a common requirement for document generation.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**
1. **Initialize Workbook and Worksheet**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.*;

   public class PaperSizeA4 {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           // Create a new workbook instance
           Workbook wb = new Workbook();

           // Access the first worksheet in the workbook
           Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
   ```
2. **Set the Paper Size**
   ```java
           // Set paper size to A4
           ws.getPageSetup().setPaperSize(PaperSizeType.PAPER_A_4);
   ```
3. **Retrieve and Print Dimensions**
   ```java
           // Retrieve and print the paper width and height in inches
           double paperWidth = ws.getPageSetup().getPaperWidth() / 72; // Convert points to inches
           double paperHeight = ws.getPageSetup().getPaperHeight() / 72;

           System.out.println("A4 Paper Width: " + paperWidth + " inches");
           System.out.println("A4 Paper Height: " + paperHeight + " inches");
       }
   }
   ```
#### Set Paper Size to Letter

**Overview**
This feature enables configuring your worksheet's size to the standard Letter format, widely used in North America.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**
1. **Initialize Workbook and Worksheet**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.*;

   public class PaperSizeLetter {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           // Create a new workbook instance
           Workbook wb = new Workbook();

           // Access the first worksheet in the workbook
           Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
   ```
2. **Set the Paper Size**
   ```java
           // Set paper size to Letter
           ws.getPageSetup().setPaperSize(PaperSizeType.PAPER_LETTER);
   ```
3. **Retrieve and Print Dimensions**
   ```java
           // Retrieve and print the paper width and height in inches
           double paperWidth = ws.getPageSetup().getPaperWidth() / 72; // Convert points to inches
           double paperHeight = ws.getPageSetup().getPaperHeight() / 72;

           System.out.println("Letter Paper Width: " + paperWidth + " inches");
           System.out.println("Letter Paper Height: " + paperHeight + " inches");
       }
   }
   ```
**Practical Applications**
- **Printing Reports:** Automatically configure reports to print on various standard sizes like A2, A3, A4, or Letter.
