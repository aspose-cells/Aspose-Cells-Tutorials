## Implementation Guide

Let’s break down our implementation into key features.

### Create and Access Workbook

**Overview:**
Creating a workbook is the first step in managing Excel files programmatically. We’ll access the first worksheet to start modifying it.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialize the Workbook:**
   ```java
   String dataDir = "YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY";
   Workbook wb = new Workbook();
   ```
2. **Access the First Worksheet:**
   ```java
   com.aspose.cells.Worksheet ws = wb.getWorksheets().get(0);
   ```

### Set Custom Paper Size for Worksheet Page Setup

**Overview:**
Customize your worksheet's page setup to ensure it prints on paper of a specific size.

#### Steps:
1. **Set Custom Paper Size:**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.PageSetup;

   ws.getPageSetup().customPaperSize(6, 4); // Set width and height in inches
   ```

### Access and Modify Cell Value

**Overview:**
Modify specific cell values to reflect your data accurately within the worksheet.

#### Steps:
1. **Access a Specific Cell:**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.Cell;

   Cell b4 = ws.getCells().get("B4");
   ```
2. **Set the Cell Value:**
   ```java
   b4.putValue("Pdf Page Dimensions: 6.00 x 4.00 in");
   ```

### Save Workbook as PDF

**Overview:**
Convert and save your workbook into a PDF format for distribution or archiving.

#### Steps:
1. **Define Output Directory:**
   ```java
   String outDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   ```
2. **Save the Workbook:**
   ```java
   import com.aspose.cells.SaveFormat;

   wb.save(outDir + "/outputCustomPaperSize.pdf", SaveFormat.PDF);
   ```
