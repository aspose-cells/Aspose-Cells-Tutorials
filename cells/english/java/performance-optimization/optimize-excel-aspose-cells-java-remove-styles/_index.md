        System.out.println("Workbook initialized successfully.");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's dive into removing unused styles from your Excel workbook.

### Removing Unused Styles in Java with Aspose.Cells

#### Overview

This feature helps declutter your workbooks by eliminating styles that are not in use. This can significantly reduce file size and improve loading times.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Load the Workbook

First, load the Excel workbook you want to optimize:

```java
import com.aspose.cells.Workbook;
import AsposeCellsExamples.Utils;

public class RemoveUnusedStyles {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String dataDir = Utils.getSharedDataDir(RemoveUnusedStyles.class) + "TechnicalArticles/";
        String inputPath = dataDir + "Styles.xlsx";
        
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook(inputPath);
        System.out.println("Workbook loaded.");
    }
}
```

##### 2. Remove Unused Styles

Next, invoke the `removeUnusedStyles` method:

```java
workbook.removeUnusedStyles();
System.out.println("Unused styles removed.");
```

##### 3. Save the Optimized Workbook

Finally, save the workbook with optimizations applied:

```java
String outputPath = dataDir + "RemoveUnusedStyles_out.xlsx";
workbook.save(outputPath);
System.out.println("Optimized file saved at: " + outputPath);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found**: Ensure your file paths are correct.
- **Library Compatibility**: Make sure you're using a compatible version of Aspose.Cells.
