# Read Glow Effect of Shape in Excel

## Introduction
Are you a programmer working with Excel files and keen on manipulating shapes and their properties, particularly glow effects? Then you’re in for a treat! Today, we’re diving into the realm of Aspose.Cells for .NET—a powerful library that allows developers to work efficiently with various Excel file formats. We’ll explore how to read glow effect properties of shapes within an Excel spreadsheet. This is not just useful for enhancing the aesthetics of your documents but also for ensuring your data visualization is on point!
By the end of this article, you'll be equipped to seamlessly extract and read the glow effect details of shapes from your Excel files. So, let’s roll up our sleeves and get started!
## Prerequisites
Before stepping into the code, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place to make this journey smooth:
1. .NET Development Environment: Ensure you have a .NET-compatible development environment set up. This could be Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET development.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: You need to have the Aspose.Cells library installed. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will help in understanding the code structure easily.
4. Sample Excel File: You should have an Excel file with shapes that contain glow effects. You can create a sample file or download one for practice.
Once you have everything set up, we can move on to the actual coding part!
## Import Packages
The first step in working with Aspose.Cells is to import the necessary namespaces at the top of your C# file. This is essential as it tells your application where to find the classes and methods defined by the Aspose.Cells library.
Here’s how to do it:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System;
```
This will give you access to the Workbook and other relevant classes needed to manipulate Excel files.
Let’s break down our example into easy-to-follow steps.
## Step 1: Set the Document Directory Path
First, you need to specify the path to your documents directory where the Excel file is located. This is crucial as it directs your application to the right folder.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Here, you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path of your file. This sets up the groundwork for the rest of the code.
## Step 2: Read the Source Excel File
Once the file path is defined, the next step is to load your Excel file into the application using the `Workbook` class.
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(dataDir + "sourceGlowEffectColor.xlsx");
```
This line initializes a new `Workbook` object using the specified path of your Excel file. Make sure your file name is correct, or it’ll throw an error.
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Now that we have our workbook ready, we need to access the specific worksheet we want to work on—typically, this would be the first worksheet.
```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
Excel files can contain multiple worksheets, and by indexing with `[0]`, we’re selecting the first one. If you want another worksheet, just change the index.
## Step 4: Access the Shape Object
Next, we need to access the shape within the worksheet. In this case, we are focusing on the first shape.
```csharp
Shape sh = ws.Shapes[0];
```
Here, we grab the first shape from the worksheet’s `Shapes` collection. If your worksheet contains more shapes and you wish to access a different one, adjust the index accordingly.
## Step 5: Read the Glow Effect Properties
With the shape accessed, it’s time to delve into its glow properties. This can give us a plethora of information such as color, transparency, and more.
```csharp
GlowEffect ge = sh.Glow;
CellsColor clr = ge.Color;
```
The `Glow` property of the shape gives us an object that contains glow specifics. We then extract the color information into a `CellsColor` object for further exploration.
## Step 6: Display the Glow Effect Properties
Lastly, let’s output the details of the glow effect properties to the console. This can help you verify the information you just accessed.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Color: " + clr.Color);
Console.WriteLine("ColorIndex: " + clr.ColorIndex);
Console.WriteLine("IsShapeColor: " + clr.IsShapeColor);
Console.WriteLine("Transparency: " + clr.Transparency);
Console.WriteLine("Type: " + clr.Type);
```
Here, we’re using `Console.WriteLine` to print various glow property details, such as the color value, index, transparency level, and more. This step solidifies your understanding of the properties available.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve just learned how to read the glow effect of shapes in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Now, you can apply these techniques to enhance your Excel manipulation tasks further. Whether you’re maintaining aesthetic quality in reports or developing stunning data presentations, knowing how to extract such properties can be incredibly beneficial. 
Don’t forget to try out different shapes and properties in your Excel files as experimentation is key to mastering any new skill.
