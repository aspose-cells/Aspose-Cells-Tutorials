# Replace Tag with Text in TextBox in Excel

## Introduction
In this article, we’ll dive into a specific task: replacing tags with text inside text boxes in an Excel sheet using Aspose.Cells. We’ll guide you through the entire process step-by-step, ensuring you grasp every detail. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll not only enhance your understanding of Aspose.Cells but also streamline your Excel-related tasks!
## Prerequisites
Before you can start, you’ll need a few things ready:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed. It’s a flexible IDE that makes coding in C# a breeze.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: If you haven’t done so already, download the Aspose.Cells library for .NET from the [page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). You can also get a free trial version to check out its features.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A basic understanding of C# programming will go a long way in helping you follow this guide easily.
Now that you’re all set, let’s move on to the fun part—writing the code!
## Import Packages
First things first—let’s import the necessary packages. This is crucial because without the right imports, your code won’t recognize the classes and methods we’ll be using.
## Start Your C# Project
Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project, preferably a Console Application, as it will allow you to see output easily.
## Add Aspose.Cells Reference
- Right click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
- Select “Add” > “Reference”.
- Browse to the location where you downloaded the Aspose.Cells library and include it in your project.
## Import the Necessary Namespaces
Once you’ve added the reference, add the following `using` directive at the top of your main file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
```
This gives you access to classes within the Aspose.Cells namespace.
Now that we’ve set up our environment, let’s get into the juicy part—coding! Our goal is to find specific tags in text boxes within an Excel file and replace them with provided text.
## Step 1: Define the Source and Output Directory
First, we need to specify where our source Excel file is located and where we want to save the modified version.
```csharp
// Source and Output Directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Change to your Directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Change to your Directory
```
## Step 2: Load the Workbook
This is where we’ll load our Excel workbook. If the file doesn’t exist, it throws an error. So, make sure your file path is correct!
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleReplaceTagWithText.xlsx");
```
Here, we’re loading an existing Excel file called `sampleReplaceTagWithText.xlsx`.
## Step 3: Define Tags and Replacement Text
Next, we need to define the tags we’re looking for and what we want to replace them with.
```csharp
string tag = "TAG_2$TAG_1";
string replace = "1$ys";
```
In this example, the tags are split using `$`. You can replace this with any delimiter you prefer.
## Step 4: Loop Over Tags and Replace
We’ll create a loop to go through each tag we want to replace. Here’s where the magic happens!
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < tag.Split('$').Length; i++)
{
    sheetReplace(wb, "<" + tag.Split('$')[i] + ">", replace.Split('$')[i]);
}
```
## Step 5: Save the Workbook
Now that we’ve made our replacements, it’s time to save the modified workbook into a desired format. Here’s how we convert it to a PDF.
```csharp
PdfSaveOptions opts = new PdfSaveOptions();
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputReplaceTagWithText.pdf", opts);
```
You can also save it in various other formats, including XLSX.
## Step 6: Implement the Replacement Logic
This is where the heart of our functionality resides. The `sheetReplace` method will handle the actual replacement in the Excel worksheets.
```csharp
public static void sheetReplace(Workbook workbook, string sFind, string sReplace)
{
    string finding = sFind;
    foreach (Worksheet sheet in workbook.Worksheets)
    {
        sheet.Replace(finding, sReplace);
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
        {
            if (sheet.PageSetup.GetHeader(j) != null)
                sheet.PageSetup.SetHeader(j, sheet.PageSetup.GetHeader(j).Replace(finding, sReplace));
                
            if (sheet.PageSetup.GetFooter(j) != null)
                sheet.PageSetup.SetFooter(j, sheet.PageSetup.GetFooter(j).Replace(finding, sReplace));
        }
    }
    foreach (Worksheet sheet in workbook.Worksheets)
    {
        sFind = sFind.Replace("<", "&lt;");
        sFind = sFind.Replace(">", "&gt;");
        foreach (Aspose.Cells.Drawing.TextBox mytextbox in sheet.TextBoxes)
        {
            if (mytextbox.HtmlText != null)
            {
                if (mytextbox.HtmlText.IndexOf(sFind) >= 0)
                {
                    mytextbox.HtmlText = mytextbox.HtmlText.Replace(sFind, sReplace);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- First, we loop through each worksheet in the workbook.
- We replace the main tag not only in the cell contents but also in headers and footers (if they exist).
- Finally, we check each text box in the sheet and replace the text within them, based on the tag we are looking for.
## Conclusion
And voila! You’ve now learned how to replace tags with text in text boxes across your Excel documents using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This can be a real time-saver, especially when dealing with repetitive tasks in spreadsheets.
