# Access Non-Primitive Shape in Excel

## Introduction
Have you ever stumbled upon a non-primitive shape in an Excel file and wondered how to access the intricate details that come with it? If you’re a developer working with .NET and looking to manipulate Excel sheets, you're in the right place! In this article, we'll explore how to efficiently access and manipulate non-primitive shapes in Excel using the Aspose.Cells library. We'll walk through a comprehensive step-by-step guide that breaks down the process, making it easy even if you’re new to the platform. So, get comfortable, and let’s dive into the fascinating world of Aspose.Cells!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the code, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:
1. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is essential to follow along smoothly.
2. Visual Studio: You should have Visual Studio installed on your machine. This is where we’ll write our code.
3. Aspose.Cells Library: You’ll need to have the Aspose.Cells library installed. You can download the latest version [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
4. Excel File: Create or obtain an Excel file that contains non-primitive shapes for testing. For this tutorial, we’ll use `"NonPrimitiveShape.xlsx"`.
Once you have these prerequisites in place, we can proceed to the fun part!
## Import Packages
The first step to get everything up and running is to import the necessary packages in your C# project. Here’s what you need to do:
### Create a New Project
- Open Visual Studio and create a new C# Console Application project.
- Choose an appropriate name for your project, such as `AsposeShapeAccess`.
### Install Aspose.Cells NuGet Package
- Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer.
- Select "Manage NuGet Packages".
- Search for `Aspose.Cells` and click "Install".
### Import the Namespace
At the top of your `Program.cs` file, import the Aspose.Cells namespace by adding the following line:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System.Collections;
using System;
```
Now, let's dive into the actual code where we will access the non-primitive shapes in our Excel file.
## Step 1: Set Up the Path to Your Document
Before we get into accessing shapes, we need to specify the directory where your Excel file is located. Here’s how to do it:
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your `NonPrimitiveShape.xlsx` file is stored. 
## Step 2: Load the Workbook
Now that we have our document path set up, it’s time to load the workbook. Here’s how you can do it:
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "NonPrimitiveShape.xlsx");
```
This line creates a new `Workbook` object, which reads the Excel file you specified earlier.
## Step 3: Access the Worksheet
Next, we’ll access the first worksheet in the workbook. Let’s do it:
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
This line accesses the first worksheet in your workbook—Excel works best when we limit our focus to one sheet at a time.
## Step 4: Access the User Defined Shape
Now comes the exciting part! We are going to access the user-defined shape (which may be non-primitive) within the worksheet.
```csharp
Shape shape = worksheet.Shapes[0];
```
Here, we’re accessing the first shape in the worksheet. You can change the index if you have multiple shapes.
## Step 5: Check if the Shape is Non-Primitive
It’s crucial to confirm whether the shape is non-primitive before proceeding to access its details:
```csharp
if (shape.AutoShapeType == AutoShapeType.NotPrimitive)
{
```
This block ensures we’re only working with shapes that have more intricate details.
## Step 6: Access Shape's Data
Now that we've confirmed it’s a non-primitive shape, we can access its data.
```csharp
ShapePathCollection shapePathCollection = shape.Paths;
```
This line retrieves the collection of paths that define the shape. Think of it like getting the blueprint for the shape’s design!
## Step 7: Loop Through Each Path
For a deeper understanding of the shape’s structure, we’ll loop through each path associated with the shape:
```csharp
foreach (ShapePath shapePath in shapePathCollection)
{
```
This loop will allow us to delve into each path and explore their details.
## Step 8: Access Path Segments
Each shape path can have multiple segments. Let’s access those!
```csharp
ShapeSegmentPathCollection pathSegments = shapePath.PathSegementList;
```
This collection holds the segments that make up the paths of the shape.
## Step 9: Loop Through Each Path Segment
Here, we’ll loop through each segment in the path segments collection:
```csharp
foreach (ShapeSegmentPath pathSegment in pathSegments)
{
```
This is where the fun part begins, as we’ll be getting into the nitty-gritty of each segment!
## Step 10: Access Path Segment Points
Now, let’s get to the individual points in each path segment:
```csharp
ShapePathPointCollection segmentPoints = pathSegment.Points;
```
Think of this as gathering all the coordinates that define the shape's curves and corners.
## Step 11: Print Points Details
Finally, let’s print the details of each point in the path segment to the console:
```csharp
foreach (ShapePathPoint pathPoint in segmentPoints)
{
    Console.WriteLine("X: " + pathPoint.X + ", Y: " + pathPoint.Y);
}
```
With this, we’re effectively outputting the coordinates of every point that defines our non-primitive shape—a fantastic way to visualize what’s going on under the hood!
## Conclusion
