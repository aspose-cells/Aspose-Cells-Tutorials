# Convert Smart Art to Group Shape in Excel

## Introduction
Excel is a versatile tool that offers a plethora of features, making it ideal for data representation and analysis. But have you ever tried to manipulate Smart Art in Excel? Converting Smart Art to Group Shape can be a bit tricky, especially if you're not familiar with the nuances of coding in .NET. Luckily for you, Aspose.Cells for .NET makes this process a walk in the park. In this tutorial, we’re going to dive into how you can convert Smart Art into a Group Shape in Excel using Aspose.Cells. So, grab your coding hat, and let’s jump right in!
## Prerequisites
Before we roll up our sleeves and start coding, let’s make sure you have everything you need to get going. Here’s what you should have:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. It’s the go-to integrated development environment (IDE) for .NET development.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You need to have this library in your project. If you haven't downloaded it yet, you can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# is a plus. You don’t need to be a wizard, but some programming background will definitely help.
4. An Excel File with Smart Art: You’ll need a sample Excel file that contains the Smart Art shape you wish to convert. You can create this file simply in Excel or find one online.
5. .NET framework: Ensure you're using an appropriate version of the .NET Framework that is compatible with Aspose.Cells.
Now that we've ticked all the boxes in our checklist, let's jump into the actual coding.
## Import Packages
To start off, we need to import the necessary packages that'll allow us to utilize the functionality of Aspose.Cells. Open your project in Visual Studio and add the following namespaces at the top of your C# file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
```
By importing these packages, you are effectively giving your code the ability to interact with Excel files and perform the necessary operations.
Let’s break this down into detailed steps. Follow along as we convert Smart Art to Group Shape in Excel.
## Step 1: Define the Source Directory
First things first, you’ll need to specify the directory where your Excel file resides. This is merely to help your code know where to look for the file.
```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load the Sample Smart Art Shape - Excel File
This is where we actually load the Excel file into our code. We’ll use the `Workbook` class for loading the file.
```csharp
// Load the excel file containing Smart Art
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleSmartArtShape_GetResultOfSmartArt.xlsx");
```
Now, `wb` holds the contents of your Excel workbook, and we can interact with it.
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Once the workbook is loaded, you’ll want to access the worksheet that contains your Smart Art. This example assumes it's the first worksheet.
```csharp
// Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
With `ws`, you are now able to manipulate the first worksheet directly.
## Step 4: Access the First Shape
Next up, we need to locate the actual shape that we are interested in. In this case, we’re retrieving the first shape on our worksheet.
```csharp
// Access first shape
Shape sh = ws.Shapes[0];
```
Good news! We now have access to the shape object.
## Step 5: Determine if the Shape is Smart Art
We want to check if the shape we’re working with is actually a Smart Art shape. 
```csharp
// Check if the shape is Smart Art
Console.WriteLine("Is Smart Art Shape: " + sh.IsSmartArt);
```
This line will give you a clear indication of whether your shape is indeed a Smart Art shape.
## Step 6: Determine if the Shape is a Group Shape
Next, we want to check if the shape is already a group shape. 
```csharp
// Check if the shape is a group shape
Console.WriteLine("Is Group Shape: " + sh.IsGroup);
```
This is crucial information that can dictate what actions we will take next.
## Step 7: Convert Smart Art Shape into Group Shape
Assuming the shape is a Smart Art, you will want to convert it into a Group Shape. This is where the magic happens.
```csharp
// Convert Smart Art shape into group shape
Console.WriteLine("Is Group Shape: " + sh.GetResultOfSmartArt().IsGroup);
```
This line of code executes the conversion. If it's successful, your Smart Art is now a Group Shape!
## Step 8: Confirm Execution
Finally, it’s always good to confirm that your operation completed successfully.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ConvertSmartArtToGroupShape executed successfully.\r\n");
```

## Conclusion
And there you have it! You've successfully converted a Smart Art layout into a Group Shape using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This powerful library simplifies complex operations and gives you the ability to manipulate Excel files like a pro. Don't shy away from experimenting with other shapes, as Aspose.Cells can handle a ton of functionalities. 
## FAQ's
### Can I convert multiple Smart Art shapes at once?
Absolutely! You could loop through all the shapes and apply the same logic to each one.
### What if my shape isn’t Smart Art?
If the shape isn’t Smart Art, the conversion will not apply, and you'll want to handle that case in your code.
### Is Aspose.Cells free to use?
Aspose.Cells offers a free trial, but for continued use, you'll need to purchase a license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).
