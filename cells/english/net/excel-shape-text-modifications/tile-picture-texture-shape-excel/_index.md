# Tile Picture as Texture in Shape in Excel

## Introduction
When it comes to enhancing the visual appeal of Excel worksheets, using pictures as textures can truly make a difference. Have you ever looked at a bland Excel sheet filled with numbers and wished for a more engaging layout? By applying pictures as textures to shapes in Excel, you can add an element of creativity that captures attention and organizes information beautifully. In this article, we will delve into how to tile a picture as a texture inside a shape in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This guide will provide you with step-by-step instructions, making it easy to follow along even if you're a beginner.
## Prerequisites
Before we start, there are a few things you'll need to ensure you have in place:
1. Visual Studio: You should have Visual Studio installed on your system. This will be our primary IDE for writing and executing the code.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: This library is essential for manipulating Excel files. You can download it from the [Aspose.Cells Downloads page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Since we will be writing our program in C#, a basic understanding of the syntax and structure will be helpful.
4. Sample Excel File: For our tutorial, we will use an Excel sample file. You can either create a simple Excel file with shapes or download a sample from the Aspose website.
## Import Packages
Before jumping into the example, let’s import the necessary packages. Here’s a basic rundown of what we need:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System;
```
About the let's break down each part of this code import:
- `Aspose.Cells` is the core library that we are using to manipulate Excel files.
- `Aspose.Cells.Drawing` is necessary when we are working with shapes in Excel.
- `System` is a standard library for building basic C# applications.
Now that we have everything set up, let's get started by tiling a picture as a texture inside a shape in our Excel document. We'll break this down into detailed steps.
## Step 1: Set Up Directory Paths
First things first, you need to set up the source and output directories. This will help you specify where your Excel file is located and where you want to save the output.
```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Replace with your actual directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Replace with your actual directory
```
In this code snippet, make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path of the directories on your computer where the sample Excel file is stored and where you want to save the new file.
## Step 2: Load the Sample Excel File
Next, we need to load the Excel file that contains the shape you want to edit. Here's how you can do this:
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleTextureFill_IsTiling.xlsx");
```
In this step, we're creating an instance of the `Workbook` class and passing our Excel file's path. The file `sampleTextureFill_IsTiling.xlsx` will be processed in the following steps.
## Step 3: Access the Worksheet
With the workbook loaded, our next goal is to access the specific worksheet we want to work on. Use the following code:
```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
Here, we're accessing the first worksheet in the workbook. If you have multiple worksheets and want to access a specific one, you can change the index to match the desired worksheet.
## Step 4: Access the Shape
After accessing the worksheet, it’s time to reach the shape that we want to fill with a picture. This can be achieved with this code:
```csharp
Shape sh = ws.Shapes[0];
```
With this line, we access the first shape in the specified worksheet. Similar to accessing the worksheet, you can modify the index value if you have multiple shapes and want to select a specific one.
## Step 5: Tile the Picture as Texture
Now for the exciting part! We will tile the picture as a texture inside the shape. Here’s how:
```csharp
sh.Fill.TextureFill.IsTiling = true;
```
By setting `IsTiling` to true, you are enabling the tiling feature, which allows the shape to display the texture in a repeated pattern rather than stretching the image. This adds creativity to your spreadsheets, especially for background visuals.
## Step 6: Save the Output Excel File
Once we've done all the modifications, the next logical step is to save our workbook with the changes made. Here’s how:
```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputTextureFill_IsTiling.xlsx");
```
We’re calling the `Save` method to write the changes to a new file named `outputTextureFill_IsTiling.xlsx` in the specified output directory.
## Step 7: Confirmation Message
Finally, it’s always nice to have some feedback to confirm that our code ran smoothly. You can use this line:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("TilePictureAsTextureInsideShape executed successfully.\r\n");
```
This message will be displayed in your console, confirming that the operation was executed successfully.
## Conclusion
