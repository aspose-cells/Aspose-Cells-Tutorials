# Setting Data Field Format Programmatically in .NET

## Introduction
If you’re diving into Excel file manipulations using .NET, you’ve probably crossed paths with datasets that require some fancy formatting. One common requirement is to set up your data fields, especially in pivot tables, in a manner that makes your data not just understandable, but visually appealing and insightful. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, this task can be a breeze. In this tutorial, we will literally break down how to set data field formats programmatically in .NET step by step, challenging the daunting complexities and making it all digestible!
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, let’s ensure you have everything sorted out. Here’s a quick checklist of what you need:
1. Visual Studio: Because who doesn’t love a good integrated development environment (IDE)?
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: You can easily download it from the [Aspose Releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: If you understand the basics of a programming language, you're good to go!
### Why Aspose.Cells?
Aspose.Cells for .NET is a powerful library specifically designed for managing Excel file operations. It allows you to read, write, manipulate, and convert Excel files easily. Imagine being able to programmatically create reports, pivot tables, or even charts without having to dig into the Excel UI - sounds like magic, right?
## Import Packages
Now that we have our prerequisites all set, let’s dive into the next steps. Start by importing the necessary packages. Here’s how you can get those up and running:
### Create a New Project
Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project. Choose a Console App template since we’ll be doing backend processing.
### Add Reference to Aspose.Cells
1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select “Manage NuGet Packages.”
3. In the Browse section, search for “Aspose.Cells.”
4. Install the library. Once installed, you're ready to import!
### Import the Required Namespaces
At the top of your C# code file, add the following namespaces:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Cells.Pivot;
```
This will give you access to the functionalities offered by Aspose.Cells.

Alright, now we get to the nitty-gritty of our program. We'll be working with an existing Excel file — let’s name it "Book1.xls" for the sake of this tutorial.
## Step 1: Define Your Data Directory
First things first, you need to tell your program where to find that precious Excel file.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Make sure to change this to your actual path!
```
## Step 2: Load the Workbook
Loading your workbook is akin to opening a book before reading it. Here’s how you do it:
```csharp
// Load a template file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "Book1.xls");
```
Make sure Book1.xls is sitting pretty in the specified directory, or else you might run into a few hiccups!
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Now that we have our workbook, let’s get our hands on the first worksheet (like the cover of our book):
```csharp
// Get the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0]; // Index starts at 0!
```
## Step 4: Access the Pivot Table
With the worksheet in our grasp, it’s time to locate the pivot table we need to work with.
```csharp
int pivotindex = 0; // Assuming you want the first pivot table
PivotTable pivotTable = worksheet.PivotTables[pivotindex];
```
## Step 5: Get the Data Fields
Now that we're in the pivot table, let’s pull out the data fields. Think of this as going into a library and fetching specific books (or data fields).
```csharp
Aspose.Cells.Pivot.PivotFieldCollection pivotFields = pivotTable.DataFields;
```
## Step 6: Access the First Data Field
From the collection of fields, we can access the first one. This is like picking the first book off the shelf to read.
```csharp
Aspose.Cells.Pivot.PivotField pivotField = pivotFields[0]; // Get first data field
```
## Step 7: Set the Data Display Format
Next up, let’s set the data display format of the pivot field. This is where you can start showing meaningful visuals — for instance, percentages:
```csharp
// Setting data display format
pivotField.DataDisplayFormat = Aspose.Cells.Pivot.PivotFieldDataDisplayFormat.PercentageOf;
```
## Step 8: Set the Base Field and Base Item
Every pivot field can be tied to another field as a base reference. Let’s set it up:
```csharp
// Setting the base field
pivotField.BaseFieldIndex = 1; // Use appropriate index for base field
// Setting the base item
pivotField.BaseItemPosition = Aspose.Cells.Pivot.PivotItemPosition.Next; // Choose the next item
```
## Step 9: Set the Number Format
Taking it a step further, let’s adjust the number format. This is akin to deciding how you want the numbers displayed — let’s make them neat!
```csharp
// Setting number format
pivotField.Number = 10; // Use format index as needed
```
## Step 10: Save the Excel File
All set and done! Time to save your changes. Your workbook is now going to reflect all the mighty changes you just made.
```csharp
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
And there you have it, folks! Your pivot table’s data fields are now formatted to perfection!
## Conclusion
