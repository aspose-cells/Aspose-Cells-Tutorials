# Setting Format Options of Pivot Table in .NET

## Introduction
Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data at your disposal? Or have you found it difficult to present this data in a clear and insightful manner? If so, welcome aboard! Today, we’re diving into the amazing world of Pivot Tables in Excel using the Aspose.Cells library for .NET. Pivot Tables can be the superheroes of data presentation, transforming heaps of numbers into structured, insightful reports that make decision-making a breeze. Isn't that a game changer?
## Prerequisites
Before we leap into the tutorial, let's ensure you're equipped with everything you need to succeed. Here are the prerequisites:
1. Basic Knowledge of C#: You should have a fundamental understanding of C# programming language. If you're comfortable with the basics, you're ready to tackle this!
2. Visual Studio or Any C# IDE: You’ll need to have an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio. This is where the magic happens. 
3. Aspose.Cells Library: To harness the power of Aspose.Cells, you'll need to download this package. You can easily find it at the [Aspose.Cells Download Page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
4. Excel File: A sample Excel file is required to practice the tutorial. Feel free to create a simple dataset in an Excel sheet (like "Book1.xls") for this exercise.
5. .NET Framework: Make sure you have the .NET framework installed on your computer.
Got all that? Fantastic! Now, let's jump into our first step.
## Import Packages
To start using the Aspose.Cells library, we first need to import the necessary packages. Here's how:
### Open Your Project
Open up your Visual Studio (or any C# IDE you’re using) and create a new project. Choose a Console Application because it will allow you to run the script easily.
### Add Aspose.Cells Reference
1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. In the search box, type `Aspose.Cells` and install it.
Now, you’re ready to bring in the library. You'll need to add the following using directive at the beginning of your code file:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Cells.Pivot;
```
This line allows you to access all the classes and methods available in the Aspose.Cells library.
With the ground laid, let's walk through each part of the process step-by-step. We will cover how to set various format options for a Pivot Table effectively.
## Step 1: Define Your Document Directory
First, you need to set the path of your document directory where your input Excel file resides. This line of code specifies where your files are located.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your "Book1.xls" file is stored. This helps the program know where to look for the input file.
## Step 2: Load the Template File
Next, we’ll load the Excel file we want to manipulate. This is done using the `Workbook` class.
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "Book1.xls");
```
Essentially, this command tells your program to open up the file "Book1.xls" so that we can work with its data.
## Step 3: Get the First Worksheet
Now that we have our workbook open, let’s dive into the worksheet which houses our data. 
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
Here, we're accessing the first worksheet of the workbook (since indexing starts from zero). If your data is on a different sheet, simply adjust the index.
## Step 4: Accessing the Pivot Table
Pivot Tables are powerful, but first, we need to grab the one we want to work with. Assuming you know your Pivot Table's index, here’s how to access it.
```csharp
int pivotindex = 0;
PivotTable pivotTable = worksheet.PivotTables[pivotindex];
```
In this case, we're accessing the first Pivot Table (index 0) in the worksheet. 
## Step 5: Set the Pivot Table Grand Totals for Rows
Let’s start formatting! We can configure whether to show grand totals for rows in our Pivot Table.
```csharp
pivotTable.RowGrand = true;
```
Setting this property to `true` will display the grand totals at the bottom of each row in your Pivot Table. It’s a simple yet effective way to provide summaries.
## Step 6: Set the Pivot Table Grand Totals for Columns
Just as we set grand totals for rows, we can also do this for columns.
```csharp
pivotTable.ColumnGrand = true;
```
Enabling this will provide totals at the right side of each column. Now your Pivot Table is a champ at summarizing data both ways!
## Step 7: Displaying Custom String for Null Values
An often overlooked detail is handling null values. You might want a specific string to appear in cells where there are null values. 
```csharp
pivotTable.DisplayNullString = true;
pivotTable.NullString = "null";
```
This sets up the Pivot Table to display "null" whenever it encounters an empty cell, adding clarity and consistency to your reports.
## Step 8: Set the Pivot Table Layout
Pivot Tables can have various layouts, and we can customize it based on our requirement. Let’s set the layout to "DownThenOver".
```csharp
pivotTable.PageFieldOrder = PrintOrderType.DownThenOver;
```
This command adjusts the order in which the fields are displayed in your report, making it easier to read. 
## Step 9: Saving the Excel File
Finally, once you've made all these beautiful adjustments, you need to save your changes back into an Excel file. 
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
This line saves the modified workbook as “output.xls” in your specified directory. 
And just like that, you’ve enhanced your Pivot Table with all these fantastic formatting options!
## Conclusion
Wow, we’ve traversed quite a journey together, haven’t we? By harnessing the capabilities of the Aspose.Cells library for .NET, you can effortlessly transform how your data looks and behaves in Excel. We covered how to load a workbook, access and format a Pivot Table, and culminated everything by saving our modifications. Data doesn't have to be drab & dreary; with a few tweaks, it can shine brilliantly.
