# Setting Page Field Format Programmatically in .NET

## Introduction
Creating and manipulating Excel files through code can be quite empowering, especially when you need to analyze large datasets. One of the fantastic tools in your arsenal is Aspose.Cells for .NET, which allows you to programmatically interact with Excel files and create complex reporting structures. In this tutorial, we’ll delve into how you can set up page field formats within a PivotTable using this powerful library. Whether you're an experienced developer or a beginner, by the end of this guide, you’ll have a strong grasp of how to operate with PivotTables and their various settings in .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive headfirst into coding, let’s make sure you have everything set up correctly. You’ll need the following:
- Visual Studio: A working environment where you can write and execute your .NET code.
- Aspose.Cells: You can download the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.
- Excel File: Have an Excel file ready (like `Book1.xls`) containing data suitable for PivotTable creation. 
If you haven’t already, get your free trial of Aspose.Cells [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).
## Import Packages
To kick things off, you'll need to import the right packages in your project. Start by adding references to the Aspose.Cells library in your C# project. Here’s how to do it:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Cells.Pivot;
```
This will pull in all the necessary classes and methods needed to manipulate Excel files using Aspose.Cells.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace
Start by defining your working directory where your Excel files will be stored. For instance, you can declare a variable like this:
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Loading the Workbook
Next up, we need to load our Excel template. This is an essential step because it establishes the context for our operations:
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "Book1.xls");
```
This line loads the existing workbook from the specified directory.
## Step 2: Access the Worksheet
Once your workbook is loaded, it's time to access the worksheet that contains the PivotTable or the data you want to analyze. Here’s how you can do that:
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
This grabs the first worksheet of the loaded workbook. You could easily modify the index if you’re working with multiple sheets.
## Step 3: Accessing the PivotTable
Continuing on, let’s access the PivotTable in our chosen worksheet. If you’re using a single PivotTable, you can set its index to `0`:
```csharp
int pivotindex = 0;
// Accessing the PivotTable
PivotTable pivotTable = worksheet.PivotTables[pivotindex];
```
This code snippet selects the first PivotTable in the worksheet. 
## Step 4: Configuring the PivotTable
Now comes the exciting part! Let’s set the PivotTable to show grand totals for the rows:
```csharp
pivotTable.RowGrand = true;
```
This line ensures that your report will display grand totals which can be a useful summary for data analysis.
## Step 5: Access and Configure Row Fields
Next, we need to access the row fields of the PivotTable:
```csharp
Aspose.Cells.Pivot.PivotFieldCollection pivotFields = pivotTable.RowFields;
```
This collection allows us to manipulate the fields as needed.
## Configure the First Row Field
Want to set specific subtotal types? Let’s access the first field in our collection and configure it:
```csharp
Aspose.Cells.Pivot.PivotField pivotField = pivotFields[0];
// Setting Subtotals.
pivotField.SetSubtotals(Aspose.Cells.Pivot.PivotFieldSubtotalType.Sum, true);
pivotField.SetSubtotals(Aspose.Cells.Pivot.PivotFieldSubtotalType.Count, true);
```
By enabling `Sum` and `Count` subtotals, we can quickly summarize data in our report.
## Step 6: Setting Autosort Options
Next, let’s put some smart sorting into play. This way, your PivotTable will arrange data in a meaningful order:
```csharp
// Setting autosort options.
pivotField.IsAutoSort = true;
pivotField.IsAscendSort = true;
pivotField.AutoSortField = -5; // Using a predefined sorting field.
```
This code snippet enables automatic sorting and specifies ascending order. 
## Step 7: Setting AutoShow Options
Would you like to filter your data further? The AutoShow option is helpful for showing specific data points under defined conditions:
```csharp
// Setting autoShow options.
pivotField.IsAutoShow = true;
pivotField.IsAscendShow = false;
pivotField.AutoShowField = 0; // Specify the field to auto show.
```
This ensures that your PivotTable only displays relevant data, enhancing clarity and focus.
## Step 8: Saving Your Work
After all those configurations, you wouldn’t want to lose your work! Save the modified workbook like this:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
Now, you can find the newly created Excel file in your documents directory.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! We’ve walked through a comprehensive and practical approach to setting page field formats programmatically in a PivotTable using Aspose.Cells for .NET. With the simple steps provided, you should feel confident in modifying your Excel data to suit your reporting needs. It’s incredible what you can achieve when you combine the power of C# with Aspose.Cells.
