# Parsing Pivot Cached Records while Loading Excel File in .NET

## Introduction
Excel files are everywhere, and if you've ever worked with Excel programmatically, you know how crucial it is to handle them effectively, especially when it comes to pivot tables. Welcome to our comprehensive guide on how to parse pivot cached records while loading an Excel file in .NET using Aspose.Cells! In this article, you'll find everything you need to know to get started, including prerequisites, code imports, step-by-step instructions, and some handy resources.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the coding sea with Aspose.Cells, there are a few things you should have ready. Don’t worry, it's simple!
### Visual Studio
- Make sure you have a copy of Visual Studio installed. It’s the trusty ship that will allow you to navigate through your code smoothly.
### Aspose.Cells for .NET
- You’ll need to have Aspose.Cells installed. You can either purchase it through their [website](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or start with a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/).
### Basic Knowledge of C#
- This guide assumes you have foundational knowledge of C#. Rather like knowing the ropes before you set sail.
### Excel File with a Pivot Table
- Have an Excel file ready that contains a pivot table because we’re going to be practicing on it!
## Import Packages
Now, let’s get our ship prepped by importing the necessary packages. In your Visual Studio project, you'll want to ensure you have these namespaces at the top of your C# file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Pivot;
```
These imports are essential as they allow you to access the powerful functionalities offered by the Aspose.Cells library.

Alright, let’s get our hands dirty! We’re going to break the code into manageable segments that'll help you understand what’s happening in each step.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Directories
Before anything, we need to specify where we are pulling our files from and where we want to save our output file.
```csharp
//Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
//Source directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your Excel files are stored. This step is crucial because if the directories aren’t set correctly, we can’t find our files, just like getting lost at sea!
## Step 2: Create Load Options
Next, we need to create an instance of `LoadOptions`. This is where we can set some parameters for how we want to load our Excel file.
```csharp
//Create load options
LoadOptions options = new LoadOptions();
```
This line prepares the load options for our workbook. It’s like prepping our gear before we dive into coding!
## Step 3: Configure Parsing Pivot Cached Records
Let’s enable the option to parse pivot cached records by setting the property to true.
```csharp
//Set ParsingPivotCachedRecords true, default value is false
options.ParsingPivotCachedRecords = true;
```
By default, the parsing of pivot cached records is set to false. Setting it to true is key to extracting the data we need from pivot tables, similar to breaking the surface of the water to find the treasures below!
## Step 4: Load the Excel File
Now we’re ready to load our Excel file!
```csharp
//Load the sample Excel file containing pivot table cached records
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleParsingPivotCachedRecordsWhileLoadingExcelFile.xlsx", options);
```
Here, we open our Excel file using the load options we configured earlier. At this point, we’ve laid our anchors down; we’re firmly docked at the Excel port!
## Step 5: Access the First WorksheetNext, we need to grab the worksheet we want to work with. Keep it simple; let’s just access the first one!
```csharp
//Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
Using zero-based indexing, this retrieves the first worksheet from the workbook. Think of it like picking the first book off the shelf!
## Step 6: Access the Pivot Table
Once we're on the right worksheet, we need to grab our pivot table.
```csharp
//Access first pivot table
PivotTable pt = ws.PivotTables[0];
```
This line extracts the first pivot table from our sheet. It’s like selecting the perfect treasure chest to open!
## Step 7: Set Refresh Data Flag
Before getting into the pivot data, we need to refresh it. Setting the refresh flag to true will allow us to pull the latest data.
```csharp
//Set refresh data flag true
pt.RefreshDataFlag = true;
```
This step ensures that we’re not working with stale data. Imagine going for a swim in a fresh lake vs. a muddy puddle; fresh is always better!
## Step 8: Refresh and Calculate Pivot Table
Now comes the exciting part: refreshing and calculating our pivot table!
```csharp
//Refresh and calculate pivot table
pt.RefreshData();
pt.CalculateData();
```
These two calls refresh our pivot table data and then calculate it. Think of it as gathering all the raw ingredients for a dish before cooking!
## Step 9: Reset Refresh Data Flag
Once we’ve refreshed and calculated, it's a good idea to reset our flag.
```csharp
//Set refresh data flag false
pt.RefreshDataFlag = false;
```
We don’t want to keep our flag up – it’s like taking down the “under construction” sign once a project is finished!
## Step 10: Save the Output Excel File
Finally, let's save our newly updated Excel file.
```csharp
//Save the output Excel file
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputParsingPivotCachedRecordsWhileLoadingExcelFile.xlsx");
```
This line saves our workbook to the specified output directory. It’s as if we are safely storing our treasure after a successful expedition!
## Step 11: Print Completion Message
Last but not least, let’s notify ourselves that the task is complete.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ParsingPivotCachedRecordsWhileLoadingExcelFile executed successfully.");
```
This confirmation message is a nice way to wrap up our journey. It’s always great to celebrate small wins!
## Conclusion
And there we have it! You’ve successfully parsed pivot cached records while loading an Excel file in .NET using Aspose.Cells. If you follow these steps, you’ll be able to manipulate Excel pivot tables like a seasoned sailor on the high seas. Remember, the key is to experiment and make the most out of your resources.
