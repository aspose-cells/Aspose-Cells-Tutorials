   ```

## Implementation Guide

### Load the Workbook

#### Overview
Start by loading an existing Excel file containing the pivot table you want to work with.

#### Code Snippet:

```csharp
// Load sample workbook
Workbook wb = new Workbook("sampleGroupPivotFieldsInPivotTable.xlsx");
```

### Access Worksheet and Pivot Table

#### Overview
Access the specific worksheet and pivot table for grouping fields.

#### Code Snippet:

```csharp
// Access the second worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[1];

// Access the pivot table
PivotTable pt = ws.PivotTables[0];
```

### Set Up Date Range for Grouping

#### Overview
Define the date range to determine how your fields are grouped.

#### Code Snippet:

```csharp
// Specify the start and end dates
DateTime dtStart = new DateTime(2008, 1, 1); // Start of January 2008
DateTime dtEnd = new DateTime(2008, 9, 5);   // End of September 2008
```

### Configure Grouping by Months and Quarters

#### Overview
Specify the grouping type for your pivot fields. Here, we focus on months and quarters.

#### Code Snippet:

```csharp
// Specify the group type list (months and quarters)
ArrayList groupTypeList = new ArrayList();
groupTypeList.Add(PivotGroupByType.Months);
groupTypeList.Add(PivotGroupByType.Quarters);

// Apply grouping on the first pivot field
pt.SetManualGroupField(0, dtStart, dtEnd, groupTypeList, 1);
```

### Refresh and Calculate Pivot Table Data

#### Overview
Refresh and recalculate data to see changes take effect.

#### Code Snippet:

```csharp
// Refresh and calculate pivot table
tp.RefreshDataFlag = true;
tp.RefreshData();
tp.CalculateData();
tp.RefreshDataFlag = false;
```

### Save Your Work

#### Overview
Save the modified workbook to preserve changes.

#### Code Snippet:

```csharp
// Save the output Excel file
wb.Save("outputGroupPivotFieldsInPivotTable.xlsx");
```
