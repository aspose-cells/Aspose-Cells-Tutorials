# How to Use Aspose.Cells for .NET to Group Rows and Columns in Excel

## Introduction

Streamline your Excel data organization with .NET by mastering row and column grouping using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This robust library lets you handle Excel files programmatically, enhancing data presentation and automating report generation.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:
- Implement row and column grouping with Aspose.Cells
- Control summary row placement below groups
- Save changes efficiently in Excel files

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before starting:
- **Aspose.Cells for .NET**: Install it via NuGet or .NET CLI.
  ```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```
  
- **Development Environment**: A setup with Visual Studio or a compatible C# IDE is assumed.
- **Knowledge Base**: Basic understanding of C#, .NET programming, and Excel file handling.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To begin, install the Aspose.Cells library as shown:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

Consider acquiring a license for full feature access. You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license.

## Basic Initialization

Initialize your first workbook like this:

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

This sets up an empty Excel file in memory, ready for manipulation using Aspose.Cells.

## Implementation Guide

### Grouping Rows and Columns

#### Overview
Group data into collapsible sections to manage large datasets effectively.

#### Step 1: Load Your Workbook

Load your existing Excel file:

```csharp
string dataDir = "path_to_your_files";
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "sample.xlsx");
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

#### Step 2: Group Rows

Group rows using the `GroupRows` method:

```csharp
worksheet.Cells.GroupRows(0, 5, true);
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `startRow`: Index of the first row to be grouped.
  - `endRow`: Index of the last row in the grouping range.
  - `treatAsHidden`: If true, rows are hidden.

#### Step 3: Group Columns

Group columns with `GroupColumns`:

```csharp
worksheet.Cells.GroupColumns(0, 2, true);
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `startColumn`: Index of the first column in the range.
  - `endColumn`: Index of the last column to be grouped.

### Controlling SummaryRowBelow

#### Overview
Set summary rows' position relative to groups (default is above).

#### Step: Adjust Property
Modify this property as needed:

```csharp
worksheet.Outline.SummaryRowBelow = false;
```

- **Purpose**: Sets the position of summary rowsâ€”`false` for above, `true` for below.

### Saving Your Workbook

Save your workbook after changes:

```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```

**Explanation**: This writes all changes back to an Excel file named `output.xls`.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
- Verify worksheet index validity before accessing it.

### Practical Applications
1. **Financial Reporting**: Simplify quarterly reports by grouping financial periods or categories.
2. **Inventory Management**: Organize inventory data by product lines for better oversight.
3. **Academic Grading**: Group student grades by subject to facilitate analysis and reporting.

Consider integrating with databases or web applications for automated Excel report generation directly from application logic.

### Performance Considerations
Optimize performance by:
- Limiting grouped rows/columns at once.
- Utilizing Aspose.Cells' efficient memory management features.
- Cleaning unused resources promptly to prevent memory leaks.

## Conclusion

You've learned how to group rows and columns in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET, along with controlling summary row placement. These skills enhance data presentation within your applications.
