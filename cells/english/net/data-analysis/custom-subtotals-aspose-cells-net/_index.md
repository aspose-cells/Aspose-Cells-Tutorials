# How to Implement Custom Subtotals in Excel with Aspose.Cells for .NET

## Introduction

Are you looking to generate customized reports with specific subtotal labels in your Excel files? This guide will show you how to achieve this using the powerful Aspose.Cells library for .NET. We'll focus on creating average subtotals that suit your needs.

**What Youâ€™ll Learn:**
- Setting up and using Aspose.Cells for .NET
- Implementing a custom class to override default subtotal names
- Adding custom subtotals to an Excel sheet
- Calculating formulas and adjusting column widths automatically

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Aspose.Cells for .NET** library installed in your project (installation steps below)
- A development environment with Visual Studio or a similar IDE that supports C# and .NET projects
- Basic knowledge of C# programming and Excel operations

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To get started, install the Aspose.Cells for .NET library using either NuGet Package Manager or the .NET CLI.

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

### License Acquisition
Aspose offers a free trial license for 30 days, allowing you to test all features without limitations. Obtain this [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/). For ongoing use, consider purchasing a full license or exploring subscription options on their [purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Initialization and Setup
Once installed, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down this implementation into steps to help you understand each part of the process.

### Step 1: Create a Custom Settings Class
First, create a custom class that extends `GlobalizationSettings`:
```csharp
class CustomSettings : GlobalizationSettings
{
    public override string GetTotalName(ConsolidationFunction functionType)
    {
        switch (functionType)
        {
            case ConsolidationFunction.Average:
                return "AVG";
            default:
                return base.GetTotalName(functionType);
        }
    }

    public override string GetGrandTotalName(ConsolidationFunction functionType)
    {
        switch (functionType)
        {
            case ConsolidationFunction.Average:
                return "GRD AVG";
            default:
                return base.GetGrandTotalName(functionType);
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** This class customizes how subtotals are named for different functions, like Average.

### Step 2: Load Your Workbook
Load your existing Excel workbook containing the data you want to manipulate:
```csharp
Workbook book = new Workbook("sampleCustomLabelsSubtotals.xlsx");
```
**Explanation:** Replace `"sampleCustomLabelsSubtotals.xlsx"` with your file path. This initializes the `Workbook` object.

### Step 3: Set Custom Globalization Settings
Assign our custom settings to the workbook:
```csharp
book.Settings.GlobalizationSettings = new CustomSettings();
```
**Explanation:** This ensures any subtotal calculations use our customized labels from `CustomSettings`.

### Step 4: Add Subtotal Functionality
Add a subtotal to your worksheet within a specified range using the average function:
```csharp
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets[0];
sheet.Cells.Subtotal(CellArea.CreateCellArea("A2", "B9"), 0, ConsolidationFunction.Average, new int[] { 1 });
```
**Explanation:** This targets cells from A2 to B9 and adds an average subtotal based on the first column (index 1).

### Step 5: Calculate Formulas and Adjust Columns
After adding subtotals, calculate any formulas and auto-fit columns:
```csharp
book.CalculateFormula();
sheet.AutoFitColumns();
```
**Explanation:** `CalculateFormula()` ensures all calculations are up-to-date. `AutoFitColumns()` adjusts the column width to fit content.

### Step 6: Save Your Workbook
Save your changes back to a new file:
```csharp
book.Save("outputCustomLabelsSubtotals.xlsx");
```
**Explanation:** This saves your modified workbook with custom subtotals and adjusted columns.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where custom subtotals can be invaluable:
1. **Financial Reporting**: Customize subtotal labels to reflect specific financial terms like "Net Average" or "Total Adjusted Revenue."
2. **Inventory Management**: Use tailored subtotals for different categories or suppliers in your inventory reports.
3. **Sales Data Analysis**: Implement average calculations that automatically update with new sales data entries.
4. **Educational Grading Systems**: Customize labels to represent averages of student scores across subjects.
5. **Business Intelligence Dashboards**: Tailor subtotal labels to match specific KPIs or metrics for better clarity.

## Performance Considerations
When working with Aspose.Cells, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- **Efficient Memory Use**: Dispose of objects no longer needed using the `Dispose()` method.
- **Batch Processing**: If processing multiple workbooks, batch operations to minimize overhead.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: For large files, implement asynchronous methods where feasible.

## Conclusion
This tutorial explored how to implement custom subtotals with Aspose.Cells for .NET. By creating a derived `GlobalizationSettings` class and manipulating Excel data programmatically, you can enhance your reporting capabilities.

**Next Steps:** Experiment further by adding other consolidation functions or integrating these functionalities into larger applications.
