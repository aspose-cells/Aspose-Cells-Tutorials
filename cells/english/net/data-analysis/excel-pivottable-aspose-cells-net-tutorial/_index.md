## Implementation Guide
Explore each feature in detail below.

### Load and Access PivotTable
#### Overview
Accessing a PivotTable is essential for data manipulation. Here's how to load an Excel file and retrieve a specific PivotTable.

#### Step-by-Step
**1. Load the Workbook:**
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Cells;
   using Aspose.Cells.Pivot;
   
   string sourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
   Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "Book1.xls");
   ```
**2. Access a Worksheet and PivotTable:**
   ```csharp
   Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
   int pivotIndex = 0;
   PivotTable pivotTable = worksheet.PivotTables[pivotIndex];
   ```
### Set Row Grand Totals and Subtotals
#### Overview
Configuring row grand totals and subtotals ensures effective data summarization.

#### Step-by-Step
**1. Access Row Fields:**
   ```csharp
   PivotFieldCollection pivotFields = pivotTable.RowFields;
   PivotField pivotField = pivotFields[0];
   ```
**2. Configure Totals and Subtotals:**
   ```csharp
   // Enable grand totals
   pivotTable.RowGrand = true;

   // Set subtotals for Sum and Count
   pivotField.SetSubtotals(PivotFieldSubtotalType.Sum, true);
   pivotField.SetSubtotals(PivotFieldSubtotalType.Count, true);
   ```
### Configure AutoSort Options
#### Overview
Auto-sorting organizes data dynamically. Here's how to configure this feature.

#### Step-by-Step
**1. Enable Auto-Sort:**
   ```csharp
   PivotField pivotField = pivotTable.RowFields[0];
   pivotField.IsAutoSort = true;
   pivotField.IsAscendSort = true; // Set sort order to ascending
   ```
**2. Define Sort Field Index:**
   ```csharp
   pivotField.AutoSortField = -5;
   ```
### Configure AutoShow Options
#### Overview
The auto-show feature displays only relevant data automatically.

#### Step-by-Step
**1. Enable Auto-Show Settings:**
   ```csharp
   PivotField pivotField = pivotTable.RowFields[0];
   pivotField.IsAutoShow = true;
   ```
**2. Configure Show Conditions:**
   ```csharp
   pivotField.AutoShowField = 0; // Based on a specific data field index
   ```
### Save the Excel File
#### Overview
After making changes, save your workbook back to disk.

#### Step-by-Step
**1. Save Workbook:**
   ```csharp
   string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
