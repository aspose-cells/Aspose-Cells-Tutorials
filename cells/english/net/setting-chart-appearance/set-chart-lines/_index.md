# Set Chart Lines

## Introduction

Creating visually appealing and informative charts is essential in data representation. Whether you're a data analyst, a business manager, or just someone who loves organizing data, charts can significantly enhance the way you present your information. This tutorial will walk you through the process of setting chart lines using Aspose.Cells for .NET, a powerful library for manipulating Excel files. By the end, you’ll know how to create stunning charts packed with customizations to make your excel data pop!

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the coding part, make sure you're equipped with the following:

- Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed. It’s highly recommended to use the latest version to leverage all features.
- .NET Framework: Your project should be based on .NET Framework (or .NET Core) where you will implement Aspose.Cells.
- Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Cells from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
- Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with the C# programming language will be helpful while coding.

## Import Packages

To get started with Aspose.Cells, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This will allow you to access all the cool features and functionalities that Aspose.Cells offers. Here’s how to import packages in your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
using System.Drawing;
```

Let’s break down the process into manageable steps so you can follow along easily.

## Step 1: Define Your Output Directory

First things first, you’ll need a place to save your newly created Excel file. Define the output directory at the top of your code like this:

```csharp
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```

Explanation: Replace "Your Output Directory" with the path where you want Aspose.Cells to save the file, such as `C:\\MyExcelFiles\\`.

## Step 2: Instantiate a Workbook Object

Now, we’ll create a workbook object, which serves as a container for your spreadsheet.

```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

Explanation: This line creates an instance of the `Workbook` class from the Aspose.Cells library. It’s like opening a new blank Excel file where you can start adding your sheets and data.

## Step 3: Reference a Worksheet

Next, you’ll need to work with a specific sheet in your workbook. We’ll grab the first worksheet.

```csharp
// Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

Explanation: Worksheets are indexed beginning at 0, so `worksheets[0]` refers to the first worksheet.

## Step 4: Add Sample Values to Cells

Let’s fill some cells with data that we will later use to create our chart.

```csharp
// Adding sample values to cells
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(50);
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(100);
worksheet.Cells["A3"].PutValue(150);
worksheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue(60);
worksheet.Cells["B2"].PutValue(32);
worksheet.Cells["B3"].PutValue(50);
```

Explanation: Here we fill cells "A1" to "A3" and "B1" to "B3" with some numerical values. These will be plotted in our chart later.

## Step 5: Add a Chart to the Worksheet

Now, it’s time to create a chart! We’ll add a column chart type.

```csharp
// Adding a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.Charts.Add(Aspose.Cells.Charts.ChartType.Column, 5, 0, 25, 10);
```

Explanation: This line adds a column chart at specific coordinates on the worksheet. The parameters define where the chart will be drawn on the grid.

## Step 6: Access the Newly Added Chart

You now need to reference the chart you just created.

```csharp
// Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
Aspose.Cells.Charts.Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[chartIndex];
```

Explanation: This gives you control over the chart instance allowing you to customize and style it further.

## Step 7: Add Data Series to the Chart

Let's add the data series for our chart.

```csharp
// Adding SeriesCollection (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "B3"
chart.NSeries.Add("A1:B3", true);
```

Explanation: This line instructs the chart to pull data from the specified range. The second parameter specifies whether the data ranges include categories.

## Step 8: Customize the Chart's Appearance

Now for the fun part - customizing your chart! Let’s change some colors.

```csharp
// Setting the foreground color of the plot area
chart.PlotArea.Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Blue;

// Setting the foreground color of the chart area
chart.ChartArea.Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Yellow;

// Setting the foreground color of the 1st SeriesCollection area
chart.NSeries[0].Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;

// Setting the foreground color of the area of the 1st SeriesCollection point
chart.NSeries[0].Points[0].Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Cyan;

// Filling the area of the 2nd SeriesCollection with a gradient
chart.NSeries[1].Area.FillFormat.SetOneColorGradient(Color.Lime, 1, Aspose.Cells.Drawing.GradientStyleType.Horizontal, 1);
```

Explanation: Here, you're customizing the colors of various components of the chart to make it visually striking. Each line targets different areas of the chart.

## Step 9: Apply Line Styles

Next, you can modify the line styles for your data series to make your chart not just pretty, but also professional.

```csharp
// Applying a dotted line style on the lines of a SeriesCollection
chart.NSeries[0].Border.Style = Aspose.Cells.Drawing.LineType.Dot;

// Applying a triangular marker style on the data markers of a SeriesCollection
chart.NSeries[0].Marker.MarkerStyle = Aspose.Cells.Charts.ChartMarkerType.Triangle;

// Setting the weight of all lines in a SeriesCollection to medium
chart.NSeries[1].Border.Weight = Aspose.Cells.Drawing.WeightType.MediumLine;
```

Explanation: The above code customizes the borders of the chart's series, giving it a dotted line and even changing the data point markers to triangles. It’s all about that personal touch!

## Step 10: Save Your Workbook

Now, let’s save your hard work into an Excel file.

```csharp
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputSettingChartLines.xlsx");
```

Explanation: This line saves your workbook with the specified name in the output directory you defined. You can now open it and see your cool chart!

## Step 11: Execution Confirmation

Finally, let’s confirm that everything went smoothly.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("SettingChartLines executed successfully.");
```

Explanation: A simple message to inform that your code executed without any issues.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve now mastered the basics of creating and customizing charts using Aspose.Cells for .NET. With just a few simple steps, you can elevate your data presentation, making it more comprehensible and visually appealing. As you experiment with other customization options, remember that a great chart not only tells a story but also engages your audience.
