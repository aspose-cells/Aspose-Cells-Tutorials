# Apply Themes in Chart

## Introduction

Creating visually appealing charts in Excel is crucial for effectively communicating your data. By applying themes, you can enhance the aesthetic of your charts, making the information not just accessible, but also engaging. In this guide, we will explore how to apply themes using Aspose.Cells for .NET. So, grab your favorite snack, and let's dive into the creative world of charts!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the coding section, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place.

### Required Software

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. It provides a friendly environment for developing .NET applications.
2. .NET Framework or .NET Core: Depending on your preference, you should have either the .NET Framework or .NET Core set up to follow along with our code.
3. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You cannot miss this! Download Aspose.Cells for .NET to get started. You can find the DLLs [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: While we’re going to walk you through the code step by step, some basic familiarity with C# will definitely help.

## Import Packages

To work with Aspose.Cells for .NET, the first step is to import the necessary packages. In your C# project, include the following namespace:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
```

Now that we have our prerequisites covered, let’s break down the process of applying themes to a chart in Excel step by step.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Output and Source Directories

The first thing we need to do is establish our output directory and source directory. This is where you’ll load your Excel files from and where the modified files will be saved.

```csharp
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";

// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Here, replace `Your Output Directory` and `Your Document Directory` with your specific paths. Having these directories clearly defined will streamline your workflow and avoid any confusion down the line.

## Step 2: Instantiate the Workbook

Next up, it's time to open the Excel file that contains the chart you want to modify. We do this by creating an instance of the `Workbook` class and loading our source file.

```csharp
// Instantiate the workbook to open the file that contains a chart
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleApplyingThemesInChart.xlsx");
```

Ensure that `sampleApplyingThemesInChart.xlsx` exists in your source directory.

## Step 3: Access the Worksheet

Now that we have our workbook set up, the next step is to access the specific worksheet that holds our chart. 

```csharp
// Get the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

In this case, we are simply grabbing the first worksheet, which is sufficient for this example. If you have multiple sheets, you can specify the sheet index or name based on your requirements.

## Step 4: Get the Chart

With the worksheet in hand, we can now access the chart that we intend to style.

```csharp
// Get the first chart in the sheet
Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[0];
```

Here we are fetching the first chart. If your worksheet contains multiple charts and you want a specific one, just change the index accordingly.

## Step 5: Apply Solid Fill to the Series

Before applying a theme, let’s ensure that our chart series has a solid fill. Here’s how you can set it up:

```csharp
// Specify the FillFormat's type to Solid Fill of the first series
chart.NSeries[0].Area.FillFormat.FillType = Aspose.Cells.Drawing.FillType.Solid;
```

This line of code ensures that the first series in the chart is set to use a solid fill.

## Step 6: Configure the Color

Now that our series is ready, we need to modify its color. This involves creating a `CellsColor` object and specifying a theme color. We'll choose an accent style for this example.

```csharp
// Get the CellsColor of SolidFill
CellsColor cc = chart.NSeries[0].Area.FillFormat.SolidFill.CellsColor;

// Create a theme in Accent style
cc.ThemeColor = new ThemeColor(ThemeColorType.Accent6, 0.6);
```

Here’s what’s happening:
1. We obtain the color of the solid fill.
2. Using `ThemeColor`, we set a color for our solid fill. You can change `Accent6` to any other theme color depending on what you like.

## Step 7: Apply the Theme to the Series

After configuring the color, it’s time to apply that new theme to our series. 

```csharp
// Apply the theme to the series
chart.NSeries[0].Area.FillFormat.SolidFill.CellsColor = cc;
```

This line effectively updates the colors in the chart. 

## Step 8: Save the Workbook

After all that hard work, we need to save our changes to a new Excel file.

```csharp
// Save the Excel file
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputApplyingThemesInChart.xlsx");
```

Here, we’re saving the modified workbook in the output directory you specified earlier. 

## Step 9: Confirmation Output

To let ourselves know that the process has been executed successfully, we can print a confirmation message:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ApplyingThemesInChart executed successfully.");
```

This line will output a message in the console stating the task has been completed.

Not only does it make your charts aesthetically pleasing, but it also helps convey your message more effectively.
