# Change Major Gridlines in Chart

## Introduction

Creating visually appealing charts in Excel is essential for effective data presentation. Whether you're a data analyst, a project manager, or just someone interested in data visualization, understanding how to customize charts can significantly enhance your reports. In this article, we’ll learn how to change the major gridlines in an Excel chart using the Aspose.Cells library for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, there are a few things you'll need to have in place to ensure a smooth experience while working with Aspose.Cells:

- Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your computer. This is where you will write and execute your code.
- Aspose.Cells for .NET: You can download the latest version of Aspose.Cells from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). If you want to experiment before you buy, you might consider signing up for a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/).
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will make it easier to follow along with the examples in this tutorial.

Once you have everything set up, we can start writing our code!

## Import Packages

To work with Aspose.Cells, the first step is to import the necessary packages in your C# project. Open your Visual Studio project and include the following using directives at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
using System.Drawing;
```

These packages allow you to access the classes and methods that you'll need for creating and modifying Excel workbooks and charts.

Now, let’s break down the process into detailed and easy-to-follow steps. We will create a simple chart with some data and then change the color of its major gridlines.

## Step 1: Set Your Output Directory

The first thing you'll want to do is define where you want to save the output Excel file. This is done by specifying a directory path in your code:

```csharp
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory"; // Update with your desired path
```

Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with the actual path where you want to save your file.

## Step 2: Instantiate a Workbook Object

Next, you need to create a new instance of the `Workbook` class. This object will represent your Excel file, allowing you to manipulate its content.

```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

This line of code initializes a new workbook, which will provide a blank canvas for our worksheet and chart.

## Step 3: Access the Worksheet

After creating the workbook, you can access its default worksheet. Worksheets in Aspose.Cells are indexed, so if you want the first worksheet, you refer to it by index `0`.

```csharp
// Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 4: Populate the Worksheet with Sample Data

Let’s add some sample values into the worksheet cells, which will serve as the data for our chart. This is important because the chart will reference this data.

```csharp
// Adding sample values to cells
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(50);
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(100);
worksheet.Cells["A3"].PutValue(150);
worksheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue(60);
worksheet.Cells["B2"].PutValue(32);
worksheet.Cells["B3"].PutValue(50);
```

Here, we enter several numeric values into specific cells. Columns "A" and "B" hold the data points we will visualize.

## Step 5: Add a Chart to the Worksheet

With our data in place, it's time to create a chart. We'll add a column chart that visualizes our dataset.

```csharp
// Adding a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.Charts.Add(Aspose.Cells.Charts.ChartType.Column, 5, 0, 25, 10);
```

In this code, we specify the type of chart (in this case, a column chart) and the position where we want to place it.

## Step 6: Access the Chart Instance

Once we create the chart, we need to access its instance to modify its properties. This is done by retrieving it through the `Charts` collection.

```csharp
// Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
Aspose.Cells.Charts.Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[chartIndex];
```

## Step 7: Add Data Series to the Chart

Now we need to bind our data to the chart. This involves specifying the cells as the data source for the chart.

```csharp
// Adding SeriesCollection (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "B3"
chart.NSeries.Add("A1:B3", true);
```

In this step, we are informing the chart of the range of data it should visualize.

## Step 8: Customize the Chart Appearance

Let’s spruce up our chart a bit by changing the colors of the plot area, chart area, and series collections. This will help our chart stand out and improve its visual appeal.

```csharp
// Setting the foreground color of the plot area
chart.PlotArea.Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Blue;

// Setting the foreground color of the chart area
chart.ChartArea.Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Yellow;

// Setting the foreground color of the 1st SeriesCollection area
chart.NSeries[0].Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;

// Setting the foreground color of the area of the 1st SeriesCollection point
chart.NSeries[0].Points[0].Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Cyan;

// Filling the area of the 2nd SeriesCollection with a gradient
chart.NSeries[1].Area.FillFormat.SetOneColorGradient(Color.Lime, 1, Aspose.Cells.Drawing.GradientStyleType.Horizontal, 1);
```

In this code, we set various colors for different parts of the chart. Customizing the appearance can make your data much more engaging!

## Step 9: Change Major Gridline Colors

Now, for the main event! To enhance readability, we will change the color of the major gridlines along both axes of our chart.

```csharp
// Setting the color of Category Axis' major gridlines to silver
chart.CategoryAxis.MajorGridLines.Color = Color.Silver;

// Setting the color of Value Axis' major gridlines to red
chart.ValueAxis.MajorGridLines.Color = Color.Red;
```

These commands set the major gridlines for the category and value axes to silver and red, respectively. This differentiation ensures your viewers can easily follow the gridlines across the chart.

## Step 10: Save the Workbook

After making all your modifications, it’s time to save the workbook. This is the final step that brings your effort to fruition.

```csharp
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputChangingMajorGridlinesInChart.xlsx");
```

This line saves your newly created Excel file to the specified output directory with a name that reflects its purpose.

## Step 11: Confirmation Message

Finally, let’s add a message to confirm that our task was successful:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Changing Major Gridlines in Chart executed successfully.");
```

This simple console output informs you that your program ran correctly without any hitches.
