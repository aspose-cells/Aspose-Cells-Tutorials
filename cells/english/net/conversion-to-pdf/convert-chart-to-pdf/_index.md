# Convert Chart to PDF in .NET

## Introduction
Are you looking to convert charts from Excel spreadsheets into PDF format using .NET? Well, you're in the right place! In this guide, we will explore the ins and outs of using Aspose.Cells to achieve this. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or a newcomer, our step-by-step approach will help you navigate the process with ease.

## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this enlightening journey, there are a few prerequisites that you need to check off your list:
### 1. .NET Framework or .NET Core Installed
Make sure you have either the .NET Framework or .NET Core installed on your machine. This guide is applicable for both environments, so no worries if you prefer one over the other!
### 2. Aspose.Cells Library
The magic happens thanks to the Aspose.Cells library, which you need to include in your project. You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
### 3. Basic Understanding of C# Programming
If you have a basic understanding of C#, that’s fantastic! You’ll find it easy to follow along with the examples we provide. If you're a beginner, don’t fret too much; we keep things simple and straightforward.
### 4. Visual Studio Setup
Whether you are using Visual Studio or any other IDE, ensure that your development environment is all set up to write and run .NET applications.
## Import Packages
To get started with the conversion, you need to import the necessary packages into your project. Here’s how to do it:
### Open Your Project
Launch Visual Studio and open the project where you want to implement this functionality.
### Install the Aspose.Cells NuGet Package
You can easily add the Aspose.Cells library via NuGet Package Manager. Here’s how:
- Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
- Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
- Search for "Aspose.Cells" and hit the Install button.
This will ensure you have all the classes and methods you need available at your fingertips!

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
```

Now, let’s get into the nitty-gritty of converting a chart to PDF format using Aspose.Cells. We’ll go through each step methodically, so you’ll know exactly what’s going on.
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Document Directory
First things first! You need to specify the path where your Excel document is stored. This is where you’ll point the Aspose.Cells library to find your .xls file.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
This line sets the `dataDir` variable to the location of your Excel file. Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with your actual path.
## Step 2: Load the Excel File
Now that you’ve set the directory, it's time to load the Excel file that contains the charts. Here's how to do that:
```csharp
// Load the Excel file containing charts
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "Sample1.xls");
```
By doing this, you're creating a new instance of `Workbook` and telling it to load your sample Excel file. Make sure that the filename and extension match your actual file.
## Step 3: Access the Correct Worksheet
Excel files may have multiple sheets, so you need to specify which one you want to work with. Here, we're accessing the first worksheet:
```csharp
// Access the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
Using the index `0` fetches the first worksheet. Adjust the index if your chart is on another sheet.
## Step 4: Access the Chart
Now that you have the worksheet, let’s grab the chart you want to convert:
```csharp
// Access the first chart inside the worksheet
Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[0];
```
This line accesses the first chart contained in the worksheet. If you have multiple charts and wish to convert another, just increase the index.
## Step 5: Convert the Chart to PDF
With your chart in hand, it's time to convert it into a PDF format. Here’s how:
```csharp
// Save the chart into PDF format
chart.ToPdf(dataDir + "Output-Chart_out.pdf");
```
This validation command tells Aspose.Cells to save the chart as a PDF in the specified output path. And voilà! Your chart is now in PDF format.
## Step 6: Save Chart to a Memory Stream
If you prefer to save the chart not to a file but rather to a memory stream (for example, if you're planning to download it dynamically), you can do so using the following code:
```csharp
// Save the chart into PDF format in stream
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
chart.ToPdf(ms);
```
By doing this, you save the chart into a `MemoryStream` rather than directly to a file. This can be particularly useful for web applications that require dynamic file generation.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve just learned how to convert an Excel chart to a PDF file using Aspose.Cells in .NET. This process not only includes simple commands but also gives you flexibility in how and where you want your charts saved. Whether you use a filesystem or a memory stream, the choice is yours!
Now, you should feel confident in converting charts to PDF in your future .NET applications. Don't hesitate to experiment with additional features of Aspose.Cells, as there's much more to discover!
