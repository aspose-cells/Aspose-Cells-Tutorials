# Handle Nested Objects with Smart Markers Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
If you’ve ever found yourself tangled up in the business of generating Excel reports or handling complex data structures with nested objects, you’ll know just how crucial it is to have the right tools. Enter Aspose.Cells for .NET—a powerful library that allows you to manipulate Excel files seamlessly. In this article, we're diving deep into how you can handle nested objects using Smart Markers in Aspose.Cells. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will walk you through each step of the process!
## Prerequisites
Before we roll up our sleeves and start coding, let’s ensure you have everything you need arranged. Here are the prerequisites you should have checked off your list:
1. Visual Studio: You’ll need this IDE installed to write and run your C# code.
2. .NET Framework: Make sure you have the .NET Framework compatible with Aspose.Cells.
3. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). Alternatively, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) to test out its features.
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you follow along smoothly.
## Import Packages
Alright, let’s kick things off by importing the necessary packages. These are fundamental to our application and will allow us to use the Aspose.Cells functionalities effectively. First things first, make sure to include the essential namespaces at the top of your code file:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
Now that we’ve got our prerequisites and packages ready, let’s move into the meat of the matter—using nested objects with Smart Markers!
## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory
When dealing with files, the first step typically involves specifying where your files are. Here, you need to set the path to the directory where your Excel template is located. This makes it easier for your program to locate the file it needs to work on.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Be sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path on your system.
## Step 2: Create the WorkbookDesigner Object
Now, let’s prepare to interact with our Excel template. We’ll create an instance of `WorkbookDesigner`, which will allow us to use smart markers for data binding.
```csharp
WorkbookDesigner designer  new WorkbookDesigner();
```
This line sets up your designer object, ready to load a workbook and process smart markers.
## Step 3: Load Your Template File
Having created your designer, it’s now time to load up that Excel template we mentioned earlier. This is where the magic starts!
```csharp
designer.Workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "SM_NestedObjects.xlsx");
```
Simply direct the path to your template. This template should contain the smart markers that will correspond to the data structure we’ll set up next.
## Step 4: Prepare the Data Source
### Create a Collection of Nested Objects
Here comes the fun part—creating the data source with nested objects. You will be making a collection of `Individual` objects, each containing a `Wife` object. Let's craft these classes first.
```csharp
System.Collections.Generic.ICollection<Individual> list = new System.Collections.Generic.List<Individual>();
```
This line initializes a list that will hold our `Individual` objects.
### Create Instances of the Individual Class
Next up, let’s create our `Individual` instances, making sure to associate a `Wife` with each.
```csharp
Individual p1 = new Individual("Damian", 30);
p1.Wife = new Wife("Dalya", 28);
Individual p2 = new Individual("Mack", 31);
p2.Wife = new Wife("Maaria", 29);
```
Here, `p1` and `p2` are instances of the `Individual` class, and we’ve launched their respective `Wife` classes. Pretty straightforward, right?
### Add Objects to the List
Once we have our objects initialized with their respective data, it’s time to add them to our list:
```csharp
list.Add(p1);
list.Add(p2);
```
This ensures that our list now holds all the necessary data.
## Step 5: Set the Data Source in the Designer
Now we will link our collection of `Individual` objects to our `WorkbookDesigner`. This is what allows Aspose to know where to pull the data from when rendering the Excel file.
```csharp
designer.SetDataSource("Individual", list);
```
The string "Individual" must match the smart marker in your Excel template.
## Step 6: Process the Markers
With everything set, we can process the smart markers present in our document template. This step essentially fills in the markers with the data from our list.
```csharp
designer.Process(false);
```
The parameter set to `false` indicates that we don't want to process any cell formulas after the data source is applied.
## Step 7: Save the Output Excel File
Finally, it’s time to save our processed workbook! Here's how you can do it:
```csharp
designer.Workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xlsx");
```
In this step, we simply save the updated workbook to a specified path. Make sure to replace `"output.xlsx"` with a name that makes sense to you!
## Conclusion
Congrats! You’ve just tackled how to handle nested objects using Smart Markers in Aspose.Cells. By following the steps outlined above, you've learned how to set up a document, prepare data from nested classes, connect it to Excel, and generate your final reports. Excel reporting can be a complex task, but with the right tools and techniques, it becomes far more manageable.
