# Use HTML Property in Smart Markers Aspose.Cells .NET

## Introduction
When it comes to manipulating Excel files within .NET applications, Aspose.Cells stands out as a powerful tool that simplifies the process. Whether you’re generating complex reports, automating repetitive tasks, or just trying to format your Excel sheets more effectively, using the HTML property with smart markers can elevate your development game. This tutorial will guide you on how to utilize this specific feature step-by-step, so you can harness the true potential of Aspose.Cells for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the nitty-gritty of using the HTML property with smart markers in Aspose.Cells, you’ll need to ensure you’ve got the following prerequisites sorted:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed. It’s the best IDE for .NET development.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Cells from the site. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming concepts will help you follow along easily. 
4. .NET Framework: Ensure you’re working within a supported version of the .NET Framework (such as .NET Framework 4.0 or above).
5. Data Directory: Set up a document directory where you’ll store your output files. 
Once you have these prerequisites in check, we can jump right into the code!
## Import Packages
Before you even start writing your code, make sure to import the necessary packages. Here’s what you need to add at the top of your C# file:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
These namespaces will allow you to work with all the features of Aspose.Cells that we’ll be utilizing in this tutorial.
Alright! Let’s break down the process into digestible steps. Follow these instructions closely, and you’ll be crafting Excel sheets with rich HTML formatting in no time!
## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Before we start writing any code, let’s create our working environment:
1. Open Visual Studio: Start by opening Visual Studio  and create a new C# console application.
2. Add References: Go to the solution explorer, right-click on your project, select “Add,” then “Reference…” and add the Aspose.Cells library you downloaded earlier.
3. Create Your Document Directory: Make a folder in your project directory named `Documents`. This is where you’ll save your output file.
## Step 2: Initialize the Workbook and WorkbookDesigner
Now it’s time to get into the core functionality. Follow these simple steps:
1. Create a New Workbook: Start by initializing a new workbook.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
2. Initialize WorkbookDesigner: This class helps to work with smart markers effectively. Initialize it as follows:
```csharp
WorkbookDesigner designer = new WorkbookDesigner();
designer.Workbook = workbook;
```
## Step 3: Utilizing Smart Markers
Smart markers are special placeholders in your Excel file that will be replaced with dynamic data. Here’s how to set them up:
1. Put a Smart Marker in a Cell: In this step, you’ll define where the smart marker will be placed in your Excel sheet.
```csharp
workbook.Worksheets[0].Cells["A1"].PutValue("&=$VariableArray(HTML)");
```
In this case, we’re placing our HTML-formatted marker in cell A1.
## Step 4: Data Source Setup
This step is crucial, as it’s where you actually define the data that will replace the smart markers.
1. Set the Data Source: Here, you’ll create an array of strings that include HTML-formatted text.
```csharp
designer.SetDataSource("VariableArray", new String[] { "Hello <b>World</b>", "Arabic", "Hindi", "Urdu", "French" });
```
Notice how "Hello <b>World</b>" includes HTML bold tags? This is where the magic happens!
## Step 5: Process the Template
After setting everything up, you need to process your template to apply the changes.
1. Process the Designer: This is where Aspose.Cells takes all the data and formats it according to your specifications.
```csharp
designer.Process();
```
## Step 6: Save Your Workbook
Finally, it’s time to save your beautifully formatted workbook. 
1. Save the Workbook to Your Directory:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
After executing this code, you’ll find an `output.xls` file created in your specified document directory filled with your HTML data.
## Conclusion
Using the HTML property with smart markers in Aspose.Cells is not only efficient but also opens up a world of possibilities for formatting your Excel documents. Whether you’re a beginner or have some experience under your belt, this tutorial should help you streamline your spreadsheet creation process.
