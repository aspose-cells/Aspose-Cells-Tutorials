# Copy Style with Smart Marker in Aspose.Cells .NET

## Introduction
In the world of data management and spreadsheet processing, Aspose.Cells for .NET is a powerful tool that allows developers to create, manipulate, and export Excel files programmatically. One of the standout features of Aspose.Cells is its ability to work with smart markers, which enables developers to easily copy styles and formats from a template file to the generated output. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using Aspose.Cells to copy styles from a template file and apply them to your generated Excel file.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following requirements in place:
1. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You can download the latest version of Aspose.Cells for .NET from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
2. Microsoft Visual Studio: You'll need a version of Microsoft Visual Studio to write and run your C# code.
3. Basic knowledge of C# and .NET: You should have a basic understanding of the C# programming language and the .NET framework.
## Import Packages
To get started, you'll need to import the necessary packages from Aspose.Cells for .NET. Add the following using statements at the top of your C# file:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Data;
```
## Create a Data Source
Let's start by creating a sample data source, which we'll use to populate our Excel file. In this example, we'll create a `DataTable` called `dtStudent` with two columns: "Name" and "Age".
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create Students DataTable
DataTable dtStudent = new DataTable("Student");
// Define a field in it
DataColumn dcName = new DataColumn("Name", typeof(string));
dtStudent.Columns.Add(dcName);
dtStudent.Columns.Add(new DataColumn("Age", typeof(int)));
// Add three rows to it
DataRow drName1 = dtStudent.NewRow();
DataRow drName2 = dtStudent.NewRow();
DataRow drName3 = dtStudent.NewRow();
drName1["Name"] = "John";
drName1["Age"] = 23;
drName2["Name"] = "Jack";
drName2["Age"] = 24;
drName3["Name"] = "James";
drName3["Age"] = 32;
dtStudent.Rows.Add(drName1);
dtStudent.Rows.Add(drName2);
dtStudent.Rows.Add(drName3);
```
## Load the Template File
Next, we'll load the template Excel file that contains the styles we want to copy. In this example, we'll assume the template file is named "Template.xlsx" and is located in the `dataDir` directory.
```csharp
string filePath = dataDir + "Template.xlsx";
// Create a workbook from Smart Markers template file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(filePath);
```
## Create a WorkbookDesigner Instance
Now, we'll create a `WorkbookDesigner` instance, which will be used to process the smart markers in the template file.
```csharp
// Instantiate a new WorkbookDesigner
WorkbookDesigner designer = new WorkbookDesigner();
// Specify the Workbook
designer.Workbook = workbook;
```
## Set the Data Source
We'll then set the data source for the `WorkbookDesigner` instance, which is the `dtStudent` `DataTable` we created earlier.
```csharp
// Set the Data Source
designer.SetDataSource(dtStudent);
```
## Process the Smart Markers
Next, we'll call the `Process()` method to process the smart markers in the template file.
```csharp
// Process the smart markers
designer.Process();
```
## Save the Excel File
Finally, we'll save the generated Excel file with the copied styles.
```csharp
// Save the Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xlsx", SaveFormat.Xlsx);
```
That's it! You've successfully used Aspose.Cells for .NET to copy styles from a template file and apply them to your generated Excel file.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to copy styles from a template file and apply them to your generated Excel file. By leveraging the power of smart markers, you can streamline your Excel generation process and ensure a consistent look and feel across your spreadsheets.
