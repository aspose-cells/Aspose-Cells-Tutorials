# Add Custom Labels with Smart Markers in Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
In the world of data analysis and reporting, the ability to customize and enhance your Excel documents can make a significant difference in the clarity and effectiveness of your presentations. One powerful tool that can help you achieve this is Aspose.Cells for .NET, a robust and flexible library that allows you to manipulate and generate Excel files programmatically.
In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll explore how you can leverage Aspose.Cells to add custom labels to your Excel documents using smart markers. By the end of this article, you'll have a deep understanding of the process and be equipped to apply these techniques to your own projects.
## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need the following:
1. Visual Studio: You'll need to have a version of Visual Studio installed on your machine, as we'll be using it to write and execute the code examples.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You'll need to have the Aspose.Cells for .NET library installed in your project. You can download the latest version from the [Aspose.Cells for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/) or use the [NuGet package manager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Cells/) to install it.
## Import Packages
Before we dive into the code, let's start by importing the necessary packages:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Data;
using System;
```
## Step 1: Prepare the Workbook with Smart Markers
The first step is to create a workbook that contains the smart markers you want to use. Smart markers are placeholders in your Excel template that can be used to dynamically insert data into the document.
To do this, you'll need to create two workbooks:
1. Template Workbook: This is the workbook that contains the smart markers you want to use.
2. Designer Workbook: This is the workbook that you'll use to process the smart markers and generate the final output.
Here's an example of how you can create these workbooks:
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Instantiate the workbook from a template file that contains Smart Markers
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "Book1.xlsx");
Workbook designer = new Workbook(dataDir + "SmartMarker_Designer.xlsx");
```
In this example, we're assuming that you have two Excel files: `Book1.xlsx` and `SmartMarker_Designer.xlsx`. The `Book1.xlsx` file contains the smart markers that you want to use, and the `SmartMarker_Designer.xlsx` file is the workbook that you'll use to process the smart markers.
## Step 2: Export Data to a Data Table
Next, we need to export the data from the first worksheet of the `workbook` to a data table. This data table will be used to fill in the smart markers in the designer workbook.
```csharp
// Export data from the first worksheet to fill a data table
DataTable dt = workbook.Worksheets[0].Cells.ExportDataTable(0, 0, 11, 5, true);
// Set the table name
dt.TableName = "Report";
```
In this example, we're exporting the data from the first worksheet of the `workbook` and storing it in a `DataTable` object. We also set the table name to "Report".
## Step 3: Create a WorkbookDesigner and Set the Data Source
Now, we'll create a `WorkbookDesigner` object and set the data source for the smart markers.
```csharp
// Instantiate a new WorkbookDesigner
WorkbookDesigner d = new WorkbookDesigner();
// Specify the workbook to the designer book
d.Workbook = designer;
// Set the data source
d.SetDataSource(dt);
```
In this step, we're creating a new `WorkbookDesigner` object and specifying the `designer` workbook as the target workbook. We then set the data source for the smart markers using the `DataTable` we created in the previous step.
## Step 4: Process the Smart Markers
Now that we've set up the data source, we can process the smart markers in the designer workbook.
```csharp
// Process the smart markers
d.Process();
```
This line of code will replace the smart markers in the designer workbook with the data from the `DataTable`.
## Step 5: Save the Output
The final step is to save the processed workbook to a new file.
```csharp
// Save the Excel file
designer.Save(dataDir + "output.xlsx", SaveFormat.Xlsx);
```
In this example, we're saving the processed workbook to a new file named "output.xlsx" in the `dataDir` directory.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to add custom labels to your Excel documents using smart markers. By following the step-by-step guide, you can now create dynamic and visually appealing reports that can be easily customized and updated as needed.
