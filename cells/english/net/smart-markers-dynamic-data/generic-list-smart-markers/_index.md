# Use Generic List in Smart Markers Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
Creating dynamic reports and data-driven applications is an essential skill in today's tech landscape. If you're working with .NET and Excel files, you’ve probably heard of Aspose.Cells, a powerful library designed specifically for manipulating Excel spreadsheets programmatically. This comprehensive guide will walk you through utilizing Generic Lists with Smart Markers in Aspose.Cells, providing you with a step-by-step approach to optimize your data handling in your applications.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the code, let’s quickly go over what you’ll need:
### Basic Knowledge of C#
You should have a foundational understanding of C# and how to work with classes and objects. If you’re lively with object-oriented programming, you’re already on the right track.
### Aspose.Cells for .NET Installed
Make sure you have Aspose.Cells installed in your .NET project. You can download the library from the [Aspose Website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). 
### Visual Studio Environment
Having Visual Studio set up on your machine is crucial. It's the most common development environment where you'll write your C# code.
### A Template File
For this tutorial, we'll be using a simple Excel template that you can set up in advance. You’ll just need a blank workbook for the demonstration.
## Import Packages
Now that we have the essentials in place, let's start by importing the necessary packages. A good rule of thumb is to include the following namespace:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```
These namespaces will provide the functionalities required for working with Excel files and styling cells.
## Step 1: Define Your Classes
First things first! We need to define our `Person` and `Teacher` classes. Here’s how:
### Define the Person Class
The `Person` class will hold basic attributes like name and age.
```csharp
public class Person
{
    int _age;
    string _name;
    
    public int Age
    {
        get { return _age; }
        set { _age = value; }
    }
    
    public string Name
    {
        get { return _name; }
        set { _name = value; }
    }
    
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        _age = age;
        _name = name;
    }
}
```
### Define the Teacher Class
Next is the `Teacher` class, which inherits from the `Person` class. This class will further encapsulate a list of students.
```csharp
public class Teacher : Person
{
    private IList<Person> m_students;
    public IList<Person> Students
    {
        get { return m_students; }
        set { m_students = value; }
    }
    
    public Teacher(string name, int age) : base(name, age)
    {
        m_students = new List<Person>();
    }
}
```
## Step 2: Initialize Workbook and Create a Designer
Now that we have our classes in place, it’s time to initialize our workbook:
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Specify your document directory
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(); // New Workbook instance
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
## Step 3: Setup Smart Markers in the Worksheet
We're going to set up smart markers in the Excel worksheet, indicating where our dynamic values will be placed.
```csharp
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue("Teacher Name");
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue("&=Teacher.Name");
worksheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue("Teacher Age");
worksheet.Cells["B2"].PutValue("&=Teacher.Age");
worksheet.Cells["C1"].PutValue("Student Name");
worksheet.Cells["C2"].PutValue("&=Teacher.Students.Name");
worksheet.Cells["D1"].PutValue("Student Age");
worksheet.Cells["D2"].PutValue("&=Teacher.Students.Age");
```
## Step 4: Apply Styling to Enhance Presentation
Any good report should be visually appealing! Let's apply some style to our headers:
```csharp
Range range = worksheet.Cells.CreateRange("A1:D1");
Style style = workbook.CreateStyle();
style.Font.IsBold = true;
style.ForegroundColor = Color.Yellow;
style.Pattern = BackgroundType.Solid;
StyleFlag flag = new StyleFlag();
flag.All = true;
range.ApplyStyle(style, flag);
```
## Step 5: Create the Teacher and Student Instances
Now, let’s create instances of our `Teacher` and `Person` classes and populate them with data:
```csharp
System.Collections.Generic.List<Teacher> list = new System.Collections.Generic.List<Teacher>();
// Create the first teacher object
Teacher h1 = new Teacher("Mark John", 30);
h1.Students = new List<Person>
{
    new Person("Chen Zhao", 14),
    new Person("Jamima Winfrey", 18),
    new Person("Reham Smith", 15)
};
// Create the second teacher object
Teacher h2 = new Teacher("Masood Shankar", 40);
h2.Students = new List<Person>
{
    new Person("Karishma Jathool", 16),
    new Person("Angela Rose", 13),
    new Person("Hina Khanna", 15)
};
// Add to the list
list.Add(h1);
list.Add(h2);
```
## Step 6: Set the Data Source for the Designer
Now we need to link our data with the worksheet we've prepared. 
```csharp
WorkbookDesigner designer = new WorkbookDesigner();
designer.Workbook = workbook;
designer.SetDataSource("Teacher", list);
```
## Step 7: Process the Markers
The next step is to process all the smart markers we placed earlier:
```csharp
designer.Process();
```
## Step 8: Autofit Columns and Save the Workbook
To make sure everything looks professional, let's auto-fit the columns and save our workbook:
```csharp
worksheet.AutoFitColumns();
designer.Workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xlsx"); // Save to the specified directory
```
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve just created an Excel worksheet dynamically, leveraging the power of Generic Lists and Smart Markers with Aspose.Cells for .NET. This skill will allow you to create complex reports easily and incorporate data-driven functionalities in your applications. Whether you're generating school reports, business analytics, or any dynamic content, the techniques in this guide will help streamline your workflow significantly.
