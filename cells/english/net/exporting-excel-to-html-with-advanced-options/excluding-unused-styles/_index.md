# Excluding Unused Styles while Exporting Excel to HTML

## Introduction
Excel files are ubiquitous in the business world, often filled with intricate styles and formats. But have you ever faced a situation where your Excel file, when exported to HTML, carries along all those unused styles? It can make your web pages look cluttered and unprofessional. Fear not! In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of excluding unused styles while exporting an Excel file to HTML using Aspose.Cells for .NET. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll navigate this process like a pro.
## Prerequisites
To effectively follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need a few things set up beforehand:
### 1. Visual Studio
Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your computer. This is where you will write and run your .NET code.
### 2. Aspose.Cells for .NET
Download the Aspose.Cells library. It’s a powerful tool for managing Excel files programmatically. You can snag it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
### 3. Basic Knowledge of C#
Familiarity with the C# programming language will help you grasp the concepts more easily.
### 4. Microsoft Excel
While we won’t necessarily need Microsoft Excel for coding, having it handy might help you for testing and validation.
With these items crossed off your list, you’re all set to dive into the world of Aspose.Cells!
## Import Packages
Before we write our code, let’s take a moment to import the necessary packages. In your Visual Studio project, ensure you include the Aspose.Cells namespace at the top of your C# file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
This line grants you access to all the functionalities provided by the Aspose.Cells library, allowing you to create and manipulate Excel files with ease.
Now that we have everything ready, we can jump straight into the tutorial. Below is a step-by-step guide breaking down the code to exclude unused styles while exporting Excel files to HTML.
## Step 1: Set the Output Directory
To kick things off, we need to define where we want our exported HTML file to be saved. This step is straightforward, and here’s how you do it:
```csharp
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
In the line above, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where you want to save the HTML file. For example, it could be something like `C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\`.
## Step 2: Create a Workbook Instance
Next, we'll create a new workbook. Think of the workbook as an empty canvas where we can paint our data and styles:
```csharp
// Create workbook
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
This line initializes a new instance of the `Workbook` class. It’s your starting point for anything Excel-related.
## Step 3: Create an Unused Named Style
Even though we’re trying to exclude unused styles, let’s create one to illustrate the process better:
```csharp
// Create an unused named style
wb.CreateStyle().Name = "UnusedStyle_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
```
In this step, we’re creating a new style but not applying it to any cells. Hence, it remains unused—perfect for our needs.
## Step 4: Access the First Worksheet
Now, let's access the first worksheet in our workbook. The worksheet is where the data magic happens:
```csharp
// Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
Just like that, you’re zeroing in on the first sheet of your workbook, ready to add some content!
## Step 5: Add Sample Data to a Cell
Let’s put some text in a cell—this step feels a bit like filling in the details on your canvas:
```csharp
// Put some value in cell C7
ws.Cells["C7"].PutValue("This is sample text.");
```
Here, we’re placing the text “This is sample text.” into cell C7 of the active worksheet. Feel free to change the text to whatever suits your project!
## Step 6: Specify HTML Save Options
Next, we'll define how we want to save our workbook. This step is crucial if you want to control whether unused styles are included in the export:
```csharp
// Specify html save options, we want to exclude unused styles
HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
// Comment this line to include unused styles
opts.ExcludeUnusedStyles = true;
```
In the code above, we create a new instance of `HtmlSaveOptions` and set `ExcludeUnusedStyles` to `true`. This tells Aspose.Cells to remove any styles that aren’t being used in the final HTML output.
## Step 7: Save the Workbook in HTML Format
Finally, it’s time to save your workbook as an HTML file. This is the rewarding part where all your previous work pays off:
```csharp
// Save the workbook in html format
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputExcludeUnusedStylesInExcelToHTML.html", opts);
```
Here, you combine your specified output directory with your desired file name to save the workbook. Voilà! Your HTML file is ready.
## Step 8: Confirm Success with Console Output
Last but not least, let’s provide some feedback that our code executed successfully:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ExcludeUnusedStylesInExcelToHTML executed successfully.");
```
This line simply outputs a success message in the console, allowing you to confirm that the whole process went off without a hitch.
## Conclusion
And that’s a wrap! You’ve successfully learned how to exclude unused styles when exporting an Excel file to HTML using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This technique not only helps you maintain a clean and professional appearance in your web content but also optimizes loading times by preventing unnecessary style bloat.
