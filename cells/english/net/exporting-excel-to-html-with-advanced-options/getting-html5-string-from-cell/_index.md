# Getting HTML5 String from Cell in Excel Programmatically

## Introduction
Excel spreadsheets are ubiquitous in data management, and sometimes we need to extract data from them programmatically. If you’ve ever found yourself needing to get HTML5 strings from cells in an Excel file, you're in the right place! In this guide, we’ll walk through how to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to accomplish this task seamlessly. We'll break down the process into easy bite-sized steps so that even beginners will feel at home. Ready to dive in?
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, let’s make sure you have everything you need to follow along. Here’s what you’ll need:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have a working copy of Visual Studio installed on your machine. You can download it from [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You should have the Aspose.Cells library. If you don't have it yet, you can easily download it from the [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A little understanding of C# programming language will be beneficial, but we’ll explain each step of the way.
## Import Packages
To get started, you'll need to import the necessary packages in your C# project. If you haven’t done this yet, here’s how:
### Create a New Project
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Click on “Create a new project”.
3. Select “Console App (.NET Core)” or “Console App (.NET Framework)”, depending on your preference.
4. Name your project and click “Create”.
### Add Aspose.Cells to Your Project
1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select “Manage NuGet Packages”.
3. Search for "Aspose.Cells" in the “Browse” section.
4. Click on “Install” to add it to your project.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now that you’ve got the prerequisites sorted out and got Aspose.Cells installed, let’s dive into the tutorial!

## Step 1: Create a Workbook
The first thing we need to do is create a new Workbook object. This object represents the Excel workbook we'll be working with.
```csharp
// Create workbook.
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
## Step 2: Access the First Worksheet
Once we have a workbook, we need to access the worksheet. Excel spreadsheets can contain multiple sheets, but for simplicity, we’ll work with the first one.
```csharp
// Access first worksheet.
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
## Step 3: Access a Specific Cell
Now, let's access cell "A1" where we will put some text. The `Cells` collection allows us to access individual cells by specifying their position.
```csharp
// Access cell A1 and put some text inside it.
Cell cell = ws.Cells["A1"];
cell.PutValue("This is some text.");
```
## Step 4: Get Normal and HTML5 Strings
After we have text in our cell, we can retrieve the normal and HTML5 formatted strings from it. Here's how you can do that:
```csharp
// Get the Normal and Html5 strings.
string strNormal = cell.GetHtmlString(false); // False for normal HTML
string strHtml5 = cell.GetHtmlString(true);  // True for HTML5
```
## Step 5: Print the Strings
Finally, let’s display the strings in the console. This is useful for verifying that everything is working as intended.
```csharp
// Print the Normal and Html5 strings on console.
Console.WriteLine("Normal:\r\n" + strNormal);
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("Html5:\r\n" + strHtml5);
Console.WriteLine("GetHTML5StringFromCell executed successfully.");
```
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully extracted HTML5 strings from a cell in an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET. By following these steps, you've not only learned how to work with Excel programmatically but also gained a better grasp of using one of the most powerful libraries available for .NET. 
What will you build next? The possibilities are endless! Whether it’s for data extraction, reporting, or even data visualization, you’re now equipped with the tools to make it happen.
