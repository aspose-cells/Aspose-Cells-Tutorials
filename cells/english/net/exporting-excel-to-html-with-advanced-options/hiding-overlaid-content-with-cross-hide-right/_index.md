# Hiding Overlaid Content with Cross Hide Right while Saving to Html

## Introduction
Have you ever found yourself dealing with messy Excel files that just don’t translate well to HTML? You’re not alone! Many people often face challenges when trying to export their spreadsheets while preserving the right content visibility. Thankfully, there’s a handy tool called Aspose.Cells for .NET that can address this issue by allowing you to hide overlaid content strategically. In this tutorial, we’ll guide you step-by-step on how to use Aspose.Cells to hide overlaid content with the 'CrossHideRight' option while saving an Excel file to HTML. 
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let’s ensure you have everything set up correctly! Here are the prerequisites you'll need to follow along:
1. Basic Knowledge of C#: If you’re familiar with C#, that’s great! We’ll be working in this language, so understanding the basics will help.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Installed: You’ll need to install Aspose.Cells for .NET. If you haven’t done so yet, head over to the [Aspose.Cells Download Page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) to get started.
3. Visual Studio Installed: An IDE like Visual Studio will make your life easier. If you don’t have it, grab it from the [website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
4. Sample Excel File: Prepare a sample Excel file, which we'll be using in our examples. Create a sample file named `sampleHidingOverlaidContentWithCrossHideRightWhileSavingToHtml.xlsx`.
5. .NET Framework or .NET Core: Make sure you have the .NET Framework or .NET Core installed on your system.
Let’s get our hands dirty and start coding! 
## Import Packages
To begin, we’ll need to import a couple of essential libraries into our C# project. Don’t worry; it’s a straightforward process!
### Create a New C# Project
Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project. You can choose a Console Application project type for this tutorial.
### Add Aspose.Cells Reference
1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Click on "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for `Aspose.Cells` and install the package.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now that we've got our setup ready, let's break down the process of saving an Excel file to HTML while employing the "CrossHideRight" technique to hide overlaid content.
## Step 1: Load the Sample Excel File
Let’s start by loading our sample Excel file.
```csharp
//Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
//Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load sample Excel file 
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleHidingOverlaidContentWithCrossHideRightWhileSavingToHtml.xlsx");
```
Here, we create an instance of the `Workbook` class that will load our Excel file. Just make sure you update `sourceDir` with the correct directory path where your Excel file resides. 
## Step 2: Specify HTML Save Options
Next up, we need to configure the HTML save options to hide the overlaid content.
```csharp
// Specify HtmlSaveOptions - Hide Overlaid Content with CrossHideRight while saving to Html
HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
opts.HtmlCrossStringType = HtmlCrossType.CrossHideRight;
```
In this step, we're creating an instance of `HtmlSaveOptions`. The `HtmlCrossStringType` property is set to `CrossHideRight` which tells the Aspose.Cells library how to handle overlaid content when exporting to HTML. Think of it as finding the perfect filter for your photo; you want to highlight just the right parts.
## Step 3: Save the Workbook as HTML
Once we've set everything up, it’s time to save our workbook to an HTML file.
```csharp
// Save to HTML with HtmlSaveOptions
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputHidingOverlaidContentWithCrossHideRightWhileSavingToHtml.html", opts);
```
This line takes our workbook (`wb`) and saves it in the specified output directory with the name `outputHidingOverlaidContentWithCrossHideRightWhileSavingToHtml.html`. It also applies our previously defined options to ensure that the overlaid content is handled as per our needs.
## Step 4: Output Success Message
Finally, let's add a success message to let us know everything executed smoothly.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("HidingOverlaidContentWithCrossHideRightWhileSavingToHtml executed successfully.");
```
This line just outputs a success message to the console. It's our way of saying, "Hey, we did it!" This feedback is great for troubleshooting; if you see this message, you know you’re all good!

## Conclusion
And voilà! You’ve successfully tucked away any overlaid content in your Excel files, making your HTML exports neat and tidy using Aspose.Cells for .NET. If you’ve followed along, you’re now equipped with some powerful capabilities for handling Excel files in your .NET applications. 
This process truly simplifies saving Excel files to HTML while considering presentation aesthetics— a win-win! Keep experimenting with the library, and you'll discover even more functionalities to enhance your projects.
