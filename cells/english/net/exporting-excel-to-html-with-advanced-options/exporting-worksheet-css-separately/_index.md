# Exporting Worksheet CSS Separately in Output HTML

## Introduction
In this guide, you’re going to learn how to export an Excel worksheet to HTML, with a special focus on exporting the CSS separately. This not only improves the maintainability of your styles but also enhances your workflow efficiency. Now, let’s dive right into the prerequisites and get our hands dirty!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the code, here’s what you need to make this tutorial smooth sailing:
1. Aspose.Cells for .NET License: You’ll need a license to fully utilize the features of Aspose.Cells. You can [download the latest version](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) or get a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) if you’re just testing the waters.
2. Development Environment: Ideally, you should have Visual Studio installed to run your .NET projects seamlessly.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Having a little grounding in C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.
4. Reference Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the [Aspose.Cells documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/) for additional features and capabilities.
Once you have these prerequisites checked off the list, we’re ready to roll with the exciting part!
## Import Packages
To get started, you will need to import the relevant namespaces from Aspose.Cells. Here’s how you can set it up:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Drawing;
```
This setup will provide you with all the necessary tools to create workbooks, manipulate worksheets, and manage styles.

Let’s break this down into manageable chunks, each step moving you closer to your goal of exporting that vibrant Excel worksheet right into an HTML file with all the CSS juice separate!
## Step 1: Set the Output Directory
The very first thing you need to do is decide where you want to save your exported HTML file. This is crucial because if you get this wrong, you might end up searching high and low for your document!
```csharp
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Simply replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where you want the file to be saved. For example: `string outputDir = @"C:\MyExports\";`.
## Step 2: Create a Workbook Object
Next, we need to create a new workbook object. Think of the workbook as your blank canvas where all the magic happens!
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
By doing this, we’ve initialized a new instance of the Workbook class. This variable `wb` will now hold our entire Excel worksheet.
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Now it’s time to dive into your canvas and grab that first worksheet. This part is straightforward, as we only need the first sheet for this tutorial.
```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
This line fetches the first worksheet in your workbook, ready for manipulation.
## Step 4: Manipulate a Cell's Value
Now onto the fun part—let’s put some data into a cell! You can choose any cell, but for this example, we’ll use cell “B5”.
```csharp
Cell cell = ws.Cells["B5"];
cell.PutValue("This is some text.");
```
With this line, we’ve inserted the text "This is some text." into cell B5. Simple, right? 
## Step 5: Set the Cell Style
Let’s add a little flair! We will style our text by changing the font color to red. 
```csharp
Style st = cell.GetStyle();
st.Font.Color = Color.Red;
cell.SetStyle(st);
```
This step retrieves the existing style of cell B5, changes the font color to red, and then re-applies the new style. Now your cell is not just another plain text box!
## Step 6: Specify HTML Save Options
At this stage, we will prepare the HTML save options. This is crucial for ensuring that your CSS gets exported separately.
```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
opts.ExportWorksheetCSSSeparately = true;
```
With the `ExportWorksheetCSSSeparately` option set to true, you’re telling the library to handle CSS styles distinctly instead of embedding them directly into the HTML file.
## Step 7: Save the Workbook as HTML
Finally, it’s time to save all the hard work! This line saves your workbook in the specified output directory as an HTML file.
```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputExportWorksheetCSSSeparately.html", opts);
```
Here, we are naming our output file `outputExportWorksheetCSSSeparately.html`. And voilà—you’ve made it!
## Step 8: Confirm Execution
To know everything went smoothly, it’s always good practice to output a confirmation message.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ExportWorksheetCSSSeparatelyInOutputHTML executed successfully.");
```
Now you can run your code, and if you see that confirmation message, congrats—you’ve successfully exported your Excel worksheet with separate CSS!
## Conclusion
And there you have it—your very own guide to exporting an Excel worksheet to HTML while keeping the CSS separate, thanks to Aspose.Cells for .NET. This not only keeps your styling organized but also gives you more flexibility whenever you need to make changes in the future.
