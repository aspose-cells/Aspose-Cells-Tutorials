# Exporting Print Area to Html in Excel Programmatically

## Introduction
When it comes to manipulating Excel files programmatically, especially when you want to export specific sections like a print area to HTML, Aspose.Cells for .NET is a stellar choice. Whether you're creating reports, dashboards, or simply sharing data, exporting the right content can save time and enhance presentation. In this guide, we'll walk through the steps of exporting a defined print area from an Excel file to an HTML format, using Aspose.Cells. Are you ready? Let’s dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the practical coding parts, let’s make sure you have everything set up. Here’s what you need to get started:
1. .NET Framework: Ensure you have a version of the .NET Framework installed on your machine, as the Aspose.Cells library runs on it.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: If you haven't done so yet, you need to download the Aspose.Cells library. Explore the [download link here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) and get your hands on the latest version.
3. IDE: A development environment or IDE (like Visual Studio) where you can write and test your code will make your life a whole lot easier.
4. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# will help you follow along better, as we will be writing code snippets in this language.
5. Sample Excel File: For this tutorial, we will be using a sample Excel file named `sampleInlineCharts.xlsx`. Make sure you have this file ready in your working directory.
Now that you have the essentials in place, we can start importing the necessary packages to our project.
## Import Packages
In C#, importing packages is straightforward. Here’s what you need to do:
### Include Aspose.Cells
Start by adding the Aspose.Cells namespace to your code file. This allows you to access all the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.Cells library.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
### Set Up Your Project
Make sure to add a reference to the Aspose.Cells DLL in your project so that your application can successfully compile the code.
### Create Your Main Program
You’re all set to start coding! Create a new console application or integrate the following code into your existing project.
Now, let’s break down the code into digestible steps. Each step will be explained in detail, so you know exactly what’s happening under the hood.
## Step 1: Load the Excel File
First, we need to load our Excel file into a `Workbook` object. This acts as your working document.
```csharp
//Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
//Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"
// Load the Excel file.
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleInlineCharts.xlsx");
```
Here, `sourceDir` is the directory where your Excel file is located. Make sure to provide the full path to access your `sampleInlineCharts.xlsx` file effectively.
## Step 2: Access the Sheet
Next, we need to access the specific worksheet that contains the print area we want to export.
```csharp
// Access the sheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
The `Worksheets` collection allows you to access individual sheets in the workbook. In this case, we're grabbing the first sheet (index `0`). 
## Step 3: Define the Print Area
Now it's time to set the print area in the worksheet. This defines the exact range of cells you want to export.
```csharp
// Set the print area.
ws.PageSetup.PrintArea = "D2:M20";
```
We're setting the print area to the cells from D2 to M20, which helps narrow down the export to only the relevant content, saving time and bandwidth while enhancing clarity.
## Step 4: Initialize HTML Save Options
Before saving our worksheet to HTML format, we need to set up the save options.
```csharp
// Initialize HtmlSaveOptions
HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions();
```
The `HtmlSaveOptions` class provides various settings for saving the workbook to HTML format, allowing fine-tuning for how the output should look.
## Step 5: Configure Export Options
At this point, we need to specify that we only want to export the defined print area.
```csharp
// Set flag to export print area only
options.ExportPrintAreaOnly = true;
```
By setting the `ExportPrintAreaOnly` property to `true`, we’re instructing the library to focus solely on the range specified in our print area. This ensures we avoid unnecessary clutter in our HTML output.
## Step 6: Save the Workbook as HTML
Finally, it’s time to save our workbook in the desired HTML format!
```csharp
// Save to HTML format
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputInlineCharts.html", options);
```
Here, `outputDir` is where you want your exported HTML file to be saved. This step creates the actual file based on the previous configurations.
## Step 7: Feedback Notification
To confirm the success of our operation, we’ll print a message to the console.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ExportPrintAreaToHtml executed successfully.");
```
## Conclusion
And there you have it! We’ve navigated the entire process of exporting a print area to HTML when working with Excel files programmatically. This knowledge not only empowers you to enhance your reporting capabilities but also streamlines your workflow, making it more efficient and effective. With Aspose.Cells, you have a powerful ally in your Excel manipulation endeavors!
