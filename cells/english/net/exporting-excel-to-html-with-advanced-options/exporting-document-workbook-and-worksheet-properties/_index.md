# Exporting Document Workbook and Worksheet Properties in HTML

## Introduction

When it comes to handling spreadsheets, we often find ourselves needing to convert Excel files into different formats for sharing, preservation, or presentation. One common task is exporting workbook and worksheet properties into HTML format. In this article, we’ll walk you through how to accomplish this using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Don't worry if you're new to coding or the Aspose library; we'll break it down step-by-step to make it easy to follow!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let's ensure you have everything you need to get started:

1. .NET Framework: Make sure your development environment is set up with .NET Framework. Aspose.Cells is compatible with .NET Framework versions up to 4.8.
   
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You’ll need to have Aspose.Cells installed. You can download the library from the [downloads page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). 

3. IDE: A suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio will simplify your coding experience.

4. Sample Excel File: For testing purposes, ensure you have an Excel file named `sampleExportDocumentWorkbookAndWorksheetPropertiesInHTML.xlsx` in your working directory.

## Import Packages

Now that we’ve covered the prerequisites, let’s start by importing the necessary packages in our C# project. Here’s how you can do that:

### Create a New Project

- Open your IDE and create a new C# project. You can choose a console application, which is perfect for running this type of task.

### Add the Aspose.Cells NuGet Package

To add the Aspose.Cells package, follow these steps:

- Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select "Manage NuGet Packages."
- In the NuGet Package Manager, search for "Aspose.Cells" and install it.
- This package will provide the necessary classes and methods to work with Excel files.

### Importing Namespaces

At the top of your main program file, ensure you include the following namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

This will give us access to the `Workbook` and `HtmlSaveOptions` classes, which we will use in our example.

Now that you’re all set up, let's break down the process into simple steps.

## Step 1: Set Up Your File Directories

First, we need to specify where our input and output files will be located. In your code, initialize the directories like this:

```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory/";  // Update with your actual path

// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory/";  // Update with your actual path
```

- Source Directory: This is where your input Excel file (`sampleExportDocumentWorkbookAndWorksheetPropertiesInHTML.xlsx`) is stored.
- Output Directory: This is the path where you want the output HTML file to be saved.

## Step 2: Load Your Excel File

Now we need to load the Excel file using the `Workbook` class:

```csharp
// Load the sample Excel file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleExportDocumentWorkbookAndWorksheetPropertiesInHTML.xlsx");
```

- Workbook Instance: The `Workbook` constructor takes the file path to your Excel file and creates a new instance that you can manipulate.

## Step 3: Set Up HTML Save Options

Next, we specify how we want to save our Excel data to HTML:

```csharp
// Specify Html Save Options
HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions();

// Prevent exporting document, workbook, and worksheet properties
options.ExportDocumentProperties = false;
options.ExportWorkbookProperties = false;
options.ExportWorksheetProperties = false;
```

- HtmlSaveOptions: This class helps manage how the Excel file will be converted to HTML.
- We set several options to `false` because we do not want to include workbook and worksheet properties in our HTML output.

## Step 4: Export Everything to HTML

Now we’re ready to save our workbook into HTML format:

```csharp
// Export the Excel file to Html with Html Save Options
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputExportDocumentWorkbookAndWorksheetPropertiesInHTML.html", options);
```

- The `Save` method takes two parameters: the file path for the output HTML file and the options we've set up. Running this will create your HTML file in the designated output directory.

## Step 5: Console Feedback

Finally, let’s provide some feedback in the console to know the process has completed successfully:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ExportDocumentWorkbookAndWorksheetPropertiesInHTML executed successfully.");
```

## Conclusion

And just like that, you’ve successfully exported workbook and worksheet properties to HTML using Aspose.Cells for .NET! You've followed a straightforward process, from setting up your environment to exporting your Excel data. The beauty of using libraries like Aspose.Cells is that it streamlines complex tasks, making life easier for developers. Now, you can share your spreadsheets more broadly with HTML, just like letting the world peek into your workbooks without giving them the entire book.
