# Setting Scalable Column Width Programmatically in Excel

## Introduction
Excel is an amazing tool that helps streamline data management, analysis, and reporting. However, sometimes aligning everything perfectly can feel like you’re trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Thankfully, with Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can not only handle your spreadsheet needs but also customize aspects like column widths programmatically. In this article, we’ll guide you in detail on how to set scalable column widths in Excel files using C#. Ready to dive in? Let’s go!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the coding, you need to set up a few things. Think of this as gathering your tools before starting a DIY project. Here’s what you’ll need:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. It’s the primary environment we’ll use for our .NET applications.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: You'll need to have Aspose.Cells for .NET installed. This can be downloaded from the [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) page. 
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A grasp of C# programming will be beneficial, as we’ll write our code in this language. If you are a beginner, don’t sweat it. We’ll explain things as we go.
4. An Excel File: For testing, ensure you have an Excel file (let's say `sampleForScalableColumns.xlsx`) ready. This will be the file we modify.
Now that you’re ready, let's break down the process step-by-step.
## Import Packages
To get started with our code, we’ll need to import the necessary libraries. Make sure you include Aspose.Cells in your project. Here’s how you can do it:
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
- Open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application.
- In the Solution Explorer, right-click on your project and select `Manage NuGet Packages`.
- Search for `Aspose.Cells` and install it. This makes sure we have access to all of Aspose.Cells functionality.
## Step 2: Add Using Directive
At the top of your C# file, you will need to import the required Aspose.Cells namespace:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
This makes the classes inside the Aspose.Cells library available for use.
Now that you’ve set everything up, let’s start with the actual coding. We’ll go through each part in detail, ensuring you understand what’s happening.
## Step 1: Define Input and Output Directories
In this initial step, you’ll specify where your input files are located and where you want the output files saved. 
```csharp
// Input directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory"; 
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"; 
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path of your directories. This is important because if the paths are incorrect, the program won't find the Excel file.
## Step 2: Load the Sample Excel File
Next, you’ll load the Excel file into a Workbook object. This object allows you to manipulate the file’s data and properties programmatically.
```csharp
// Load sample source file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleForScalableColumns.xlsx");
```
In this code, we create a new `Workbook` instance, passing in the path to your Excel file. If the file doesn’t exist there, you'll get an error.
## Step 3: Specify HTML Save Options
Choosing how you want to save your modified workbook is crucial. We’ll opt to save it as an HTML file for this example, but you could also save it in Excel formats as needed.
```csharp
// Specify Html Save Options
HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions();
```
Here, we instantiate a new `HtmlSaveOptions` object which will be used to set our file’s saving characteristics.
## Step 4: Set the Property for Scalable Width
This is the heart of our task. With this step, you'll allow the columns in the HTML output to have scalable widths:
```csharp
// Set the property for scalable width
options.WidthScalable = true;
```
By setting `WidthScalable` to `true`, you ensure that the column widths adjust dynamically, making your HTML output look nice on different devices and screen sizes.
## Step 5: Specify Image Save Format 
In this step, you will decide how to handle images when converting the document. Here’s how to do that:
```csharp
// Specify image save format
options.ExportImagesAsBase64 = true;
```
By exporting images as Base64, you are embedding them directly in the HTML, which is helpful if you want a standalone HTML file without separate image files.
## Step 6: Save the Workbook 
Finally, it’s time for the grand finale—saving the modified workbook. 
```csharp
// Save the workbook in Html format with specified Html Save Options
wb.Save(outputDir + "outsampleForScalableColumns.html", options);
```
This line saves your `Workbook` to the output directory specified earlier using the options defined. 
## Step 7: Confirmation Message
Just to wrap things up neatly, let’s print a success message:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("SetScalableColumnWidth executed successfully.\r\n");
```
This simple line ensures you know the process has completed.
## Conclusion
And there you go! You’ve just set scalable column widths for an Excel file programmatically using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This can significantly improve the way your data is presented in HTML format, especially for usability across different devices. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just dipping your toes into coding, Aspose.Cells provides a powerful toolset that simplifies Excel file manipulation.
