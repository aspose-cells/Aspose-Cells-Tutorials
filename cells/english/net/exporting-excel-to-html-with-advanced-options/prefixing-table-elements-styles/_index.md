# Prefixing Table Elements Styles with Html Save Options

## Introduction
In the ever-evolving world of data presentation, visually appealing formats are not just a luxury but a necessity. If you're working with Excel files in .NET, you've probably considered how to enhance your spreadsheets' aesthetics when exporting to HTML. This is where Aspose.Cells shines. In this guide, we'll dive into the intricacies of prefixing table element styles with HTML save options using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this step-by-step tutorial will have you covered.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, ensure you have the necessary tools in place:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. It's the preferred environment for .NET development.
2. .NET Framework: Familiarize yourself with the basic .NET framework, as we will be using C# in our examples.
3. Aspose.Cells Library: You will need the Aspose.Cells library. You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
4. Basic Understanding of C#: While we’re breaking down every step, having a fundamental understanding of C# will greatly help your learning process.
With these prerequisites in place, you’re ready to create beautiful HTML tables directly from your Excel data!
## Import Packages
To start using Aspose.Cells, you need to import the required namespaces. Here’s how you do it:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
These namespaces provide essential classes and functions that make our task easier, from creating workbooks to modifying cell styles.

Now, let’s break this down into digestible steps. We’ll create a workbook, manipulate some styles, and save it to HTML format using Aspose.Cells.
## Step 1: Define Your Output Directory
First, set up an output directory for saving your HTML file. This is important because it keeps things organized.
```csharp
//Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Change this to your desired output directory
```
## Step 2: Create an Instance of the Workbook
Next, we need to create the workbook object. This is like opening a new Excel file where you can start entering data or formatting.
```csharp
//Create workbook object
Workbook wb = new Workbook(); // You’ve just created a new workbook in memory
```
Here, the `Workbook` class is fundamental for any operations you want to perform with Excel files. 
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Every workbook contains at least one worksheet. We’ll access the first one to start manipulating cell data.
```csharp
//Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0]; // Selecting the first sheet
```
## Step 4: Manipulate Cell Data
Now, let's dive in and put some text into a specific cell. For this example, we'll be focusing on cell B5.
```csharp
//Access cell B5 and put value inside it
Cell cell = ws.Cells["B5"]; // Get a reference to cell B5
cell.PutValue("This is some text."); // Add some text to the cell
```
Isn’t it simple? You’re just using a string and assigning it to a cell. No complicated syntax here!
## Step 5: Style the Cell
Now, we want to style the cell. We'll make the font color red, just to spice things up a bit.
```csharp
//Set the style of the cell - font color is Red
Style st = cell.GetStyle(); // Get the current style of the cell
st.Font.Color = Color.Red; // Set the font color to red
cell.SetStyle(st); // Apply the new style to the cell
```
A little stylistic choice goes a long way, huh? Your data is now more appealing to the eye.
## Step 6: Specify HTML Save Options
Here’s where the magic happens. You can define options for saving the workbook to HTML, such as adding a CSS ID to your table.
```csharp
//Specify html save options - specify table css id
HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions(); // Create options for our HTML save
opts.TableCssId = "MyTest_TableCssId"; // Assign a CSS ID
```
This ID can be a handy tool when you want to further style the table with CSS.
## Step 7: Save the Workbook
Now for the grand finale: saving the workbook as an HTML file. 
```csharp
//Save the workbook in html 
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputTableCssId.html", opts); // Save with options applied
```
You now have an HTML representation of your Excel data, complete with the styles you’ve set up.
## Step 8: Confirm the Execution
Lastly, let's print a simple confirmation message to ensure everything went smoothly.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("PrefixTableElementsStylesWithHtmlSaveOptions_TableCssIdProperty executed successfully.");
```
This message lets you know that your code has run without any hiccups.
