# Using Font Underline Type in Excel

## Introduction
When it comes to creating spreadsheets or manipulating Excel files in .NET applications, efficiency and ease of use are paramount. Aspose.Cells for .NET is a powerful library that allows developers to work with Excel files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to use the font underline type in Excel using Aspose.Cells. We'll provide easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions, ensuring that you can grasp the concepts and apply them in your own projects without any hassle!
## Prerequisites
Before diving into our code examples, there are a few prerequisites to ensure your development environment is ready to go.
### Basic Knowledge of C#
You should have a basic understanding of C# programming. Familiarity with object-oriented principles will also help you grasp the concepts better.
### Installed Visual Studio
To effectively run and test your code, having Visual Studio installed is essential. You can download it from the [Microsoft website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
### Aspose.Cells for .NET
Make sure you've installed the Aspose.Cells for .NET library. You can either download it from the [Aspose releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) or use NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
### .NET Framework
Ensure that you have the appropriate .NET framework set up in your project. Aspose.Cells supports various versions; check their documentation for compatibility.
With these prerequisites in place, you're ready to create your first Excel document with underlined text!
## Import Packages
To get started, you’ll need to import a few essential namespaces into your C# project. Here’s how to do that:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
Including these namespaces will give you access to all the classes and methods you'll need to work with Excel files using Aspose.Cells.

Now that we have everything set up, let’s break down each aspect of the code required to underline text in an Excel cell.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory
Before anything else, you'll need a location on your drive where you can save your Excel files. Here’s how you create this directory:
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
This snippet checks if the specified directory exists. If it doesn’t, it creates it for you. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with your desired path.
## Step 2: Instantiate a Workbook Object
Next, you'll want to create a new instance of a workbook, which is essentially your Excel file. Here’s how:
```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
This line initializes a new workbook. Think of it as opening a blank canvas where you can start crafting your masterpiece.
## Step 3: Add a New Worksheet
Once you have your workbook, you’re going to need a worksheet to work with. Let’s add one:
```csharp
// Adding a new worksheet to the Excel object
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();
```
This adds a new worksheet to your workbook and stores the index of the newly added sheet in the variable `i`.
## Step 4: Reference the New Worksheet
Now, you need to get a reference to the worksheet you just added. This allows you to manipulate it:
```csharp
// Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];
```
With this step, you’re directly pointing your code to that new worksheet, ready to add content.
## Step 5: Access a Specific Cell
Now it’s time to decide where you want your text to be. In this case, we’ll use cell A1:
```csharp
// Accessing the "A1" cell from the worksheet
Aspose.Cells.Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
```
Here, we grab the cell at position A1 so we can insert some text.
## Step 6: Add Value to the Cell
Let’s put some content into that cell:
```csharp
// Adding some value to the "A1" cell
cell.PutValue("Hello Aspose!");
```
At this point, “Hello Aspose!” is now the content of your A1 cell. Simple, right?
## Step 7: Obtain the Cell Style
To underline the text, you'll need access to its style properties. Here’s how you can retrieve the current style of the cell:
```csharp
// Obtaining the style of the cell
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
```
This line fetches the existing style applied to the cell, allowing you to modify it.
## Step 8: Set the Font to Be Underlined
Now comes the exciting part! Let’s update the font style:
```csharp
// Setting the font to be underlined
style.Font.Underline = FontUnderlineType.Single;
```
This changes the font underline property to a single underline. You can also explore other types, but for now, let's keep it simple!
## Step 9: Apply the Style to the Cell
You can’t stop halfway! Now you need to set this updated style back to your cell:
```csharp
// Applying the style to the cell
cell.SetStyle(style);
```
Voila! The cell now reflects the new style with underlined text.
## Step 10: Save the Workbook
Finally, let’s save your masterpiece to an Excel file:
```csharp
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
```
This line saves the workbook in the Excel 97-2003 format. Make sure the filename and path is correctly set to where you want the file to reside.
## Conclusion
As you've seen, working with Aspose.Cells for .NET is not just powerful, but also user-friendly, allowing you to create and manipulate Excel files effortlessly. Underlining text in a cell is just scratching the surface of what this library can do.
