### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize Aspose.Cells in your project:
```csharp
var loadOptions = new HtmlLoadOptions(LoadFormat.Html);
loadOptions.SupportDivTag = true;

// Create a Workbook object with HTML content
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(htmlStream, loadOptions);
```

## Implementation Guide

### Converting HTML Layouts to Excel Workbooks

#### Step 1: Prepare Your HTML Source
Create an HTML string representing your data layout. The example below demonstrates structuring an HTML snippet with nested div tags.

```csharp
var export_html = @"<html>
                    <body>
                        <table>
                            <tr>
                                <td>
                                    <div>This is some Text.</div>
                                    <!-- Nested divs for additional text and data -->
                                    <div><span>This is more Text</span></div>
                                    <div><span>abc@abc.com</span></div>
                                    <div><span>1234567890</span></div>
                                    <div><span>ABC DEF</span></div>
                                    <div>Generated On May 30, 2016 02:33 PM<br />
                                        Time Call Received from Jan 01, 2016 to May 30, 2016
                                    </div>
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                    <!-- Image integration -->
                                    <img src='" + sourceDir + "sampleDivTagsLayout_ASpose_logo_100x100.png' />
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </body>
                    </html>";
```

#### Step 2: Load HTML into Aspose.Cells Workbook
Use `MemoryStream` to load the HTML content and specify that div tags should be supported.

```csharp
var ms = new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(export_html));

// Create workbook using load options
Workbook wb = new Workbook(ms, new HtmlLoadOptions(LoadFormat.Html)
{
    SupportDivTag = true // Enable support for div tag layouts
});
```

#### Step 3: AutoFit Rows and Columns
Auto-fitting rows and columns ensures optimal display in your Excel sheet.

```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
ws.AutoFitRows();
ws.AutoFitColumns();
```

#### Step 4: Save as XLSX File
Save the workbook to an .xlsx file format for further use or distribution.

```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputDivTagsLayout.xlsx", Aspose.Cells.SaveFormat.Xlsx);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: HTML content not rendering correctly. Ensure `SupportDivTag` is set to true.
- **MemoryStream Issues**: Verify the encoding type matches your HTML content's character set.

## Practical Applications
1. **Data Migration**: Easily transfer data from web forms or reports into Excel for analysis.
2. **Reporting**: Generate dynamic reports by converting complex web layouts directly into spreadsheets.
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with systems requiring data in Excel format, such as accounting software.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of `MemoryStream` and Workbook objects appropriately after use to free resources.
- **Batch Processing**: For large datasets, process HTML content in batches to minimize memory consumption.
