## Implementation Guide (H2)

Let's explore the key features of exporting Excel files using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

### Exporting an Excel File (H2)

#### Overview
Exporting involves loading data and saving it in a specific format. This section focuses on exporting data as an `.xls` file from an ASP.NET application.

#### Step 1: Configure Your Environment (H3)
Ensure you have set up the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using System.Web;
using Aspose.Cells;
```

#### Step 2: Load and Save Workbook (H3)
Here's how to load data into a workbook and export it as an Excel file:
```csharp
public static void Run()
{
    // Define the path for document storage
    string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir(System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().DeclaringType);
    
    // Initialize HTTP response object
    HttpResponse Response = null;
    
    // Create a new workbook instance
    Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
    
    if (Response != null)
    {
        // Save the workbook in Excel 2007 format (.xls)
        workbook.Save(Response, dataDir + "output.xls", ContentDisposition.Inline, new XlsSaveOptions());
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Workbook Instance**: Represents your Excel file.
- **HttpResponse**: Outputs the file directly in a web application context.
- **XlsSaveOptions**: Configures how the workbook is saved.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure `Response` is not null before saving.
- Check server write permissions for file storage.
