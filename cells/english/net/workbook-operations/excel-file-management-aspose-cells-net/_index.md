### Implementation Guide

#### Creating and Initializing an Excel Workbook

**Overview**: This feature demonstrates how you can start by creating a new instance of `Workbook`, which represents your Excel file.

**Step-by-step Implementation**:

1. **Define Output Directory**
   - Set up a variable to store the path where you wish to save or load files.
   ```csharp
   string outputDir = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   ```

2. **Create Workbook Instance**
   - Instantiate `Workbook` to create an empty Excel document.
   ```csharp
   Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
   ```
   At this point, you have a basic, modifiable workbook object.

#### Adding Custom XML Parts to the Workbook

**Overview**: Learn how to include custom XML data within your Excel file. This can be beneficial for associating metadata or additional structured information with your workbook.

1. **Prepare Your XML Data**
   - Define XML content as a string.
   ```csharp
   string booksXML = @"<catalog>
      <book>
         <title>Complete C#</title>
         <price>44</price>
      </book>
      ...
   </catalog>";
   ```

2. **Add Custom XML to Workbook**
   - Use the `Add` method on `ContentTypeProperties` to associate your XML with a unique name.
   ```csharp
   workbook.ContentTypeProperties.Add("BookStore", booksXML);
   ```

#### Saving the Workbook

**Overview**: Finally, let's save our modifications into an Excel file on disk.

1. **Define File Path**
   - Ensure you have a valid path for saving your file.
   
2. **Save the Workbook Instance**
   ```csharp
   workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputUsingCustomXmlParts.xlsx");
   ```
   Your workbook is now saved as an `.xlsx` file in the specified location.

### Practical Applications
