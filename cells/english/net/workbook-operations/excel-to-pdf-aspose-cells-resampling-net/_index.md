# Convert Excel Files to PDF with Image Resampling Using Aspose.Cells for .NET

## Introduction
In today's data-driven world, converting Excel files into universally accessible formats like PDF is crucial. Ensuring high-quality images during this conversion can be challenging. This tutorial demonstrates how to convert an Excel file to a PDF while maintaining image quality through resampling using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you are a developer or a business professional looking to streamline document processing, mastering this technique will elevate your efficiency.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to load and open an existing Excel file with Aspose.Cells
- Configuring PDF save options for high-quality image resampling
- Saving the converted PDF with custom settings

Let's dive into how you can achieve seamless Excel-to-PDF conversion in .NET. Ensure you have all prerequisites covered first.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have:
- **Aspose.Cells for .NET** library installed
- A .NET development environment set up (e.g., Visual Studio)
- Basic understanding of C# programming and file I/O operations

### Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET
To get started with Aspose.Cells for .NET, follow these installation steps:

#### Using .NET CLI:
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

#### Using Package Manager:
```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

**License Acquisition:**
You can start with a free trial or request a temporary license for extended testing. If satisfied, you can purchase a full license to unlock complete functionality.

After installation, initialize your project and set up basic configurations as follows:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

// Create a new workbook instance (optional setup)
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the implementation into manageable steps for better understanding.

### Open and Load an Excel File
This feature demonstrates how to access an existing Excel file using Aspose.Cells, allowing you to manipulate or convert it as needed.

#### Specify Source Directory
Ensure your source directory path is correctly set.
```csharp
string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Load the Workbook
Create an instance of `Workbook` with the specified file path.
```csharp
// Define the Excel file path
cString filePath = SourceDir + "/sampleResamplingAddedImages.xlsx";

// Open an existing Excel file using Aspose.Cells.Workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(filePath);
```

### Configure PdfSaveOptions for Image Resampling
Configuring PDF save options allows you to manage how images are resampled during conversion, ensuring quality is retained.

#### Create PdfSaveOptions Instance
```csharp
PdfSaveOptions pdfSaveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
```

#### Set Image Resample Properties
Specify the desired DPI and image quality level.
```csharp
// Enable resampling and set properties
pdfSaveOptions.setResample(true);
pdfSaveOptions.setImageResample(300, 70); // Parameters: DPI, Quality Level
```

### Save an Excel File as a PDF
Finally, save your loaded workbook to a PDF file using the configured `PdfSaveOptions`.

#### Define Output Path
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
cString outputPath = outputDir + "/outputResamplingAddedImages.pdf";
```

#### Save Workbook as PDF
Utilize the save method with specified options.
```csharp
// Save the workbook as a PDF file
workbook.save(outputPath, pdfSaveOptions);
```

## Practical Applications
- **Business Reporting:** Convert monthly financial reports from Excel to PDF for easy distribution while maintaining image clarity.
