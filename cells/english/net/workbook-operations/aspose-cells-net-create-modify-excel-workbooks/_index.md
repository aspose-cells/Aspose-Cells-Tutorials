### Creating a New Workbook Instance
#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to create an instance of the `Workbook` class in Aspose.Cells, representing an Excel file.

**Steps:**
1. **Instantiate the Workbook Class**
   Start by creating a new workbook object:
   ```csharp
   Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
   ```
2. **Verify Workbook Creation**
   Check that the workbook is created with at least one worksheet:
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Created workbook with " + workbook.Worksheets.Count + " worksheets.");
   ```

### Obtaining Worksheet Reference and Modifying a Cell
#### Overview
Learn how to access worksheets within your workbook and modify cell content, such as adding text or numbers.

**Steps:**
1. **Access the First Worksheet**
   Retrieve the first worksheet from the workbook:
   ```csharp
   Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
   ```
2. **Modify a Cell's Content**
   Access and update the value of cell "A1":
   ```csharp
   Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
   cell.PutValue("Hello World");
   ```

### Setting Superscript Effect on Text in a Cell
#### Overview
This feature shows how to apply text effects, specifically superscript, to enhance your Excel content.

**Steps:**
1. **Access the Cell and Set Value**
   Access the desired cell and set its initial value:
   ```csharp
   Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
   cell.PutValue("Hello");
   ```
2. **Apply Superscript Effect**
   Modify the font style to include superscript:
   ```csharp
   Style style = cell.GetStyle();
   style.Font.IsSuperscript = true;
   cell.SetStyle(style);
   ```

### Saving Workbook as an Excel File
