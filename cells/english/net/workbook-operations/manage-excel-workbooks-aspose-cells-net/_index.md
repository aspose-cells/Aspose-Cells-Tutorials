   license.SetLicense("Aspose.Cells.lic");
   ```
With these steps complete, you're ready to implement features using Aspose.Cells for .NET.
## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the implementation into specific features:
### Instantiate a Workbook
**Overview:** Creating an Excel workbook is straightforward with Aspose.Cells. This feature demonstrates how to initialize a new workbook.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Create a New Workbook:**
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

string SourceDir = @"YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Instantiate a new Workbook
var workBook = new Workbook();
```
**Explanation:** Here, `Workbook` is instantiated with default settings, ready for manipulation.
### Modify Cells in Worksheets
**Overview:** This feature allows you to access and modify cells within an Excel workbook's worksheets.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Access First Worksheet:**
```csharp
var sheet1 = workBook.Worksheets[0];
sheet1.Cells["A1"].Value = "DEMO TEXT ON SHEET1";
```
**Add and Modify a New Worksheet:**
```csharp
// Add a new worksheet to the workbook
workBook.Worksheets.Add(SheetType.Worksheet);

var sheet2 = workBook.Worksheets[1];
sheet2.Cells["A1"].Value = "DEMO TEXT ON SHEET2";
```
**Explanation:** Cells are accessed using both indices and keys. You can add worksheets dynamically and set values as needed.
### Set Active Worksheet Index
**Overview:** This feature allows you to specify which worksheet is currently active within the workbook.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Set Active Worksheet:**
```csharp
workBook.Worksheets.Add(SheetType.Worksheet);
// Set the active sheet index to 1, making Sheet2 the current active worksheet
workBook.Worksheets.ActiveSheetIndex = 1;
```
**Explanation:** The `ActiveSheetIndex` is set using a zero-based integer that corresponds to the worksheet's position.
### Save Workbook as SVG
**Overview:** This feature demonstrates how to save an Excel workbook in SVG format, rendering only the active worksheet.
#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Save Active Worksheet as SVG:**
```csharp
workBook.Worksheets.Add(SheetType.Worksheet);
workBook.Worksheets.ActiveSheetIndex = 1;

// Save the workbook as SVG
workBook.Save(outputDir + "Demo.svg");
```
**Explanation:** The `Save` method with `.svg` format renders only the active worksheet to an SVG file.
## Practical Applications
Aspose.Cells for .NET can be used in various real-world scenarios:
- **Automated Report Generation:** Automatically generate and export reports from data stored in Excel files.
- **Data Transformation:** Transform and manipulate large datasets within Excel workbooks programmatically.
- **Dynamic Spreadsheet Creation:** Create dynamic spreadsheets with customized content based on user input or external data sources.
## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance is crucial when working with large datasets:
- **Memory Management:** Dispose of objects properly to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing:** Process data in batches to minimize memory usage and improve execution speed.
- **Efficient Data Access:** Use direct cell access methods instead of iterating over entire ranges whenever possible.
