# Detect Link Types in Workbook

## Introduction
When it comes to handling Excel files programmatically, Aspose.Cells for .NET is among the user-friendly libraries available. With its robust features, it allows you to manipulate Excel spreadsheets, automate data entry, and analyze content—all without the need for Microsoft Excel. Today, we’re diving into an exciting feature: detecting link types in your Excel workbooks. Let’s get started!
## Prerequisites
Before we begin our adventure into detecting link types, there are a few prerequisites you should consider:
1. Basic Knowledge of C#: Since we’ll be coding in C#, familiarity with its syntax will be helpful.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Cells library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Visual Studio IDE: A coding environment like Visual Studio can make the process smoother.
4. Excel File: Have an Excel file ready with some hyperlinks set up for testing.
Once you've got these prerequisites sorted, you're ready to rock and roll!
## Import Packages
To begin writing our application, we first need to import the necessary Aspose.Cells package. Open your C# project and include the following namespace:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells.WebExtensions;
using System;
```
This line is essential as it allows us to access all the functions and classes provided by the Aspose.Cells library.
Now that we've squared away the necessary groundwork, let’s move on to the meat of the matter—detecting link types in an Excel workbook! Here’s how to do it step-by-step.
## Step 1: Set the Source Directory
First off, we need to define the source directory where our Excel file is located. This is where we'll point our code to locate "LinkTypes.xlsx". If the file isn’t located correctly, our program won’t be able to access it. So, let’s get that path right!
```csharp
string SourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your Excel file resides.
## Step 2: Initialize the Workbook
Next, we create a `Workbook` object, which represents the Excel file we're working with. By passing the file path to the constructor, we can start interacting with the workbook.
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDir + "LinkTypes.xlsx");
```
By doing this, we tell Aspose.Cells to load our Excel file into memory, giving us the ability to manipulate and analyze the data it contains.
## Step 3: Access the Worksheet
Once the workbook is loaded, we’ll need to get access to the specific worksheet that contains the hyperlinks we want to analyze. In this case, we’ll start with the first worksheet (default).
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
This line selects the first worksheet. If you want to work with a different one, you can change the index accordingly. 
## Step 4: Create a Range
Now, we want to define the range in which we’ll search for hyperlinks. Here, we create a range from A1 to A7.
```csharp
Range range = worksheet.Cells.CreateRange("A1", "A7");
```
Think of this range like a spotlight—it's where we’ll look for hyperlinks in our dataset!
## Step 5: Retrieve Hyperlinks from Range
Next up, we’ll get all the hyperlinks that exist within the specified range. This is where the magic happens!
```csharp
Hyperlink[] hyperlinks = range.Hyperlinks;
```
This pulls in all hyperlinks, allowing us to sift through them and find out what types they are.
## Step 6: Loop Through Hyperlinks and Detect Their Types
Now for the fun part! We’ll loop through each hyperlink in our `hyperlinks` array and print out the text to display along with the link type.
```csharp
foreach (Hyperlink link in hyperlinks)
{
	Console.WriteLine(link.TextToDisplay + ": " + link.LinkType);
}
```
This line of code will output each hyperlink’s display text followed by its type. You'll see results like "Google: External" if the hyperlink leads to Google!
## Step 7: Confirm Execution
Finally, we’ll keep things tidy by adding a confirmation message that our program executed successfully. It’s always good practice to let users know everything went smoothly!
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("DetectLinkTypes executed successfully.");
```
And that's it! You've now written your first Aspose.Cells program to detect and print hyperlink types in Excel workbooks.
## Conclusion
Detecting link types in Excel spreadsheets can be incredibly useful for data management. Whether you're cleaning up your database or just curious about the types of links in your documents, Aspose.Cells for .NET makes it a breeze. Now that you have this foundational knowledge, feel free to play around with other functionalities in Aspose.Cells.
