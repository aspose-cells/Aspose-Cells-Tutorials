# Filter Defined Names while Loading Workbook

## Introduction
Welcome to the ultimate guide on how to filter defined names while loading a workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET! If you’re busy navigating Excel files and need to improve your workflow, you’ve come to the right place. I’ll walk you through each step of this process, making sure it’s as easy and engaging as possible. So, grab your favorite drink, settle in, and let’s dive into the exciting world of Aspose.Cells!
## Prerequisites
Before we get rolling with our tutorial, let’s cover a few prerequisites to ensure that you’re well-prepped for success. Here’s what you’ll need:
1. Visual Studio: To write and execute your .NET code.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). A free trial is available if you want to test it out first—grab it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).
3. Basic Understanding of C#: While I’ll break everything down step-by-step, having a background in C# will make your life a lot easier.
4. Your Own Excel Files: You’ll need an Excel file with defined names for our examples. Don’t worry; we’ll work through how to create one too.
Got all that? Great! Let’s proceed.
## Import Packages
To utilize Aspose.Cells, you first need to import the required packages. Here’s how you can do it:
### Open Visual Studio
Fire up your Visual Studio and create a new C# project. This could be a Console Application or any type of application you prefer.
### Add Reference to Aspose.Cells Library
1. Download the Aspose.Cells for .NET package if you haven’t already.
2. In your Visual Studio project, right-click on References in the Solution Explorer.
3. Click on Add Reference, and browse to the Aspose.Cells DLL you just downloaded.
4. Select it and hit OK.
Once you do this, you’ll be able to access all the power of Aspose.Cells in your project!
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
Now, let’s jump right into the meat of the tutorial! We’ll be creating a simple feature that filters out defined names from an Excel workbook while loading it. Let’s go through this process step-by-step.
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Directories
First things first, you need to define where all your files will be stored.
```csharp
//Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory"; // e.g., "C:\\Documents\\ExcelFiles\\"
//Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"; // e.g., "C:\\Documents\\ExcelFiles\\Output\\"
```
Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your Excel files are located. If you get this wrong, your code won’t be able to find your files!
## Step 2: Specify Load Options
Next, we will specify the load options for our workbook. This is where the magic starts to happen.
```csharp
LoadOptions opts = new LoadOptions();
// We do not want to load defined names
opts.LoadFilter = new LoadFilter(~LoadDataFilterOptions.DefinedNames);
```
In this step, we create a new `LoadOptions` object and set its `LoadFilter`. This filter tells Aspose to skip over defined names while loading the workbook, which is exactly what we want. Think of it like asking a librarian to ignore certain sections of a book while you’re browsing.
## Step 3: Load the Workbook
Now that we have set up our load options, it’s time to load the workbook!
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleFilterDefinedNamesWhileLoadingWorkbook.xlsx", opts);
```
You should replace `"sampleFilterDefinedNamesWhileLoadingWorkbook.xlsx"` with the name of your actual Excel file. By using the `opts`, we ensure that any defined names in the Excel file will be overlooked when loading the workbook.
## Step 4: Save the Output Excel File
Finally, we need to save our processed workbook.
```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputFilterDefinedNamesWhileLoadingWorkbook.xlsx");
```
This line saves our filtered workbook to a new file. It’s like turning in a paper where you’ve revised out the unnecessary sections to focus on what really matters.
## Step 5: Confirmation Message
To bring it all home, add a confirmation message to let you know your operations were successful:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("FilterDefinedNamesWhileLoadingWorkbook executed successfully.");
```
This will display a friendly message in the console when everything goes smoothly. It’s like that satisfying moment when you hit “send” on a well-crafted email!
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully filtered defined names while loading a workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This method will not only improve your efficiency but also make your Excel file management more straightforward and focused. So, the next time you deal with complex Excel files, remember this guide, and you’ll handle defined names like a pro!
