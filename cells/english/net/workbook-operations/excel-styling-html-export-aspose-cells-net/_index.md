using Aspose.Cells;

// Initialize workbook
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

## Implementation Guide

### Create and Style a Cell

Learn how to create an Excel workbook, access specific cells, and apply custom styles.

#### Overview

We'll start by creating a workbook, accessing the "B5" cell, adding text content, and styling it with red font color.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create Workbook and Access Cell**
   
   Initialize your workbook and select the worksheet:
   
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Cells;
   using System.Drawing;
   
   string SourceDir = @"YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
   string outputDir = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   
   Workbook wb = new Workbook();
   Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
   Cell cell = ws.Cells["B5"];
   ```

2. **Set Cell Value and Style**
   
   Add text to the cell and apply a red font color:
   
   ```csharp
   cell.PutValue("This is some text.");
   Style st = cell.GetStyle();
   st.Font.Color = Color.Red;
   cell.SetStyle(st);
   ```

#### Key Configuration Options
- **Font Color**: Customize with any `System.Drawing.Color` value.
- **Cell Value**: Use `.PutValue()` for various data types.

### Export Workbook as HTML with Separate CSS

Learn how to export a styled workbook into HTML format, enabling separate CSS styling for each worksheet.

#### Overview

We’ll export the styled workbook into HTML format and configure it to have CSS separated from content.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Export Workbook**
   
   After setting up your cell style, use `HtmlSaveOptions` to define how you want the HTML output:
   
   ```csharp
   HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
   opts.ExportWorksheetCSSSeparately = true;
   wb.Save(outputDir + "outputExportWorksheetCSSSeparately.html", opts);
   ```

#### Key Configuration Options
- **ExportWorksheetCSSSeparately**: Set to `true` for separate CSS files.

## Practical Applications

- **Web Dashboard Reporting**: Style and export financial reports as HTML for web dashboards.
- **Data Portability**: Export styled Excel data into user-friendly HTML formats for sharing.
- **E-Learning Modules**: Integrate with educational content management systems for dynamic lesson plans.
- **Inventory Management Systems**: Export inventory lists with clear, styled formatting for online viewing.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large Excel files:
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of objects when no longer needed.
- Use `Workbook` methods efficiently to minimize computational overhead.
- Apply best practices in .NET for managing resources and avoiding leaks.
