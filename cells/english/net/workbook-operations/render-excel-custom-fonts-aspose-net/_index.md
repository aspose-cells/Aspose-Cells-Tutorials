# Render Excel Files to PNG, TIFF, and PDF with Custom Fonts Using Aspose.Cells for .NET

## Introduction

Maintaining font integrity during the conversion of Excel files into images or PDFs is crucial for brand consistency. Aspose.Cells for .NET offers a robust solution by allowing you to specify custom default fonts in your document conversions.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through rendering Excel files into PNG, TIFF, and PDF formats using Aspose.Cells for .NET with specified custom default fonts. This is ideal if you:
- Aim for consistent typography in rendered documents.
- Need to customize font settings during conversions.
- Want to explore configuration options within Aspose.Cells for .NET.

Let's set up your environment and implement these features seamlessly.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- **.NET Environment**: Set up on your machine (preferably .NET Core or .NET Framework).
- **Aspose.Cells for .NET Library**: Installed in your project.
- **Excel File**: An Excel workbook with data to convert.

### Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To begin, add the Aspose.Cells library to your project:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

## Implementation Guide

### Rendering to PNG with Custom Default Font

Rendering an Excel worksheet into a PNG while setting a custom default font ensures visual consistency. Here's how:

#### Step 1: Configure Image Options

Configure rendering options for your image output.
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Rendering;

// Specify directories.
string SourceDir = @"YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Open an Excel file.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDir + "sampleSetDefaultFontPropertyOfPdfSaveOptionsAndImageOrPrintOptions.xlsx");

// Set up image rendering options.
ImageOrPrintOptions imgOpt = new ImageOrPrintOptions();
imgOpt.ImageType = Drawing.ImageType.Png;
imgOpt.CheckWorkbookDefaultFont = false; // Use a custom font for missing fonts in the workbook.
imgOpt.DefaultFont = "Times New Roman";
```

#### Step 2: Render and Save

Render your worksheet to an image file using these settings.
```csharp
// Render the first worksheet into a PNG image.
SheetRender sr = new SheetRender(workbook.Worksheets[0], imgOpt);
sr.ToImage(0, outputDir + "out1_imagePNG.png");
```

### Rendering to TIFF with Custom Default Font

TIFF format is ideal for high-quality images. Here's how you can render an entire workbook as a TIFF file:

#### Step 3: Set Up Image Options for TIFF

Configure rendering options specifically for TIFF output.
```csharp
// Reuse previously defined directories and open the Excel file.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDir + "sampleSetDefaultFontPropertyOfPdfSaveOptionsAndImageOrPrintOptions.xlsx");

// Configure image rendering options for TIFF.
imgOpt.ImageType = Drawing.ImageType.Tiff;
```

#### Step 4: Render Entire Workbook to TIFF

Convert the entire workbook into a single TIFF file.
```csharp
// Render the workbook as a TIFF image.
WorkbookRender wr = new WorkbookRender(workbook, imgOpt);
wr.ToImage(outputDir + "out1_imageTIFF.tiff");
```

### Rendering to PDF with Custom Default Font

Saving an Excel workbook as a PDF while ensuring font consistency is crucial for professional documentation.

#### Step 5: Configure PDF Save Options

Set up necessary options for saving your file as a PDF.
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

// Reopen the workbook.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDir + "sampleSetDefaultFontPropertyOfPdfSaveOptionsAndImageOrPrintOptions.xlsx");

// Set up PDF save options.
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
saveOptions.DefaultFont = "Times New Roman";
saveOptions.CheckWorkbookDefaultFont = false; // Use a custom font for missing fonts in the workbook.
```

#### Step 6: Save as PDF

Export your workbook into a PDF document.
```csharp
// Save the workbook as a PDF file.
workbook.Save(outputDir + "out1_pdf.pdf", saveOptions);
```

## Practical Applications

- **Business Reports**: Ensure consistent branding in all exported reports by using custom fonts.
- **Document Archiving**: Convert legacy Excel files into PDFs for easy sharing and archiving with uniform typography.
- **Graphic Design**: Create high-resolution TIFF images of Excel data for presentations or design projects.

Integration with other systems, such as CRM platforms or document management solutions, can further enhance these use cases by automating exports based on specific triggers or events.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing your rendering process is crucial:
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of `Workbook`, `SheetRender`, and `WorkbookRender` objects promptly to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing**: If dealing with multiple files, implement batch processing for efficient handling.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize asynchronous methods where possible to improve responsiveness in applications.

## Conclusion

You've now mastered rendering Excel workbooks into PNG, TIFF, and PDF formats while setting custom default fonts using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This capability ensures your documents maintain visual integrity across various platforms and uses.
