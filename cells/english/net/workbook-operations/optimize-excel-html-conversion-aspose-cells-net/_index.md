## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To get started with Aspose.Cells for .NET, you need to add it as a dependency to your project. Here's how:

### Installation via Package Manager
If you're using the NuGet Package Manager Console, run:
```shell
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

### Installation via .NET CLI
Alternatively, if you prefer using .NET CLI, execute:
```shell
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Download a temporary license to test the full capabilities of Aspose.Cells without limitations.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
To initialize Aspose.Cells in your project:
1. Create a new C# console application.
2. Add the `Aspose.Cells` package using one of the methods above.
3. Include necessary namespaces at the top of your program file.

```

## Implementation Guide

### Overview
This section will guide you through configuring and executing Excel to HTML conversion with scalable columns using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

#### Step 1: Load Your Workbook
Start by loading the source Excel workbook that you want to convert. This involves setting up your input and output directories:

```csharp
// Input directory
string sourceDir = RunExamples.Get_SourceDirectory();

// Output directory
string outputDir = RunExamples.Get_OutputDirectory();
```

#### Step 2: Configure HTML Save Options
Create an instance of `HtmlSaveOptions` to manage how the Excel file is saved as HTML. This includes enabling scalable columns and exporting images as Base64.

```csharp
// Specify Html Save Options
HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions();

// Set the property for scalable width
options.WidthScalable = true;

// Export images as Base64 to embed them in HTML
options.ExportImagesAsBase64 = true;
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Finally, save the workbook to an HTML file with your configured options:

```csharp
// Load sample source file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleForScalableColumns.xlsx");

// Save the workbook in Html format
wb.Save(outputDir + "outsampleForScalableColumns.html", options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths to directories are correct and accessible.
- Verify that you have a valid Aspose.Cells license set up if using advanced features.
