# Add Custom XML Parts with ID to Workbook

## Introduction
When it comes to managing and manipulating Excel files programmatically, Aspose.Cells for .NET stands out as a powerful tool. One of its intriguing features is the ability to integrate custom XML parts into your Excel workbook. This might sound a bit technical, but don’t worry! By the end of this guide, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to add custom XML parts with IDs to your workbook and retrieve them when needed. 
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, it's essential to have a few things set up:
1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine, as we'll be using it for coding.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You need to have Aspose.Cells for .NET installed. If you haven’t done this yet, you can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. .NET Framework: Familiarity with the .NET framework and C# programming language will be helpful. 
Once you have the prerequisites in place, it's time to crush it with some coding magic!
## Import Packages
To use Aspose.Cells, you’ll need to add the required namespace at the top of your code. Here’s how to do it:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
This line allows you to access all the functionality provided by Aspose.Cells.
Now that we’ve set the stage, let’s break down the process into manageable steps. This way, you'll be able to follow along without feeling overwhelmed. 
## Step 1: Create an Empty Workbook
To kick things off, you need to create an instance of the `Workbook` class, which represents your Excel workbook.
```csharp
// Create empty workbook.
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
This simple line initializes a new workbook where we can add our custom XML parts.
## Step 2: Prepare Your XML Data and Schema
Next, you need to prepare some data in the form of a byte array. Although our example uses placeholder data, in a real-world scenario, you’d replace these byte arrays with actual XML data and schema that you want to integrate into your workbook.
```csharp
// Some data in the form of byte array.
// Please use correct XML and Schema instead.
byte[] btsData = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 };
byte[] btsSchema = new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 };
```
Remember, while this example uses simple byte arrays, you’d typically use valid XML and schema here.
## Step 3: Add Custom XML Parts
Now it’s time to add your custom XML parts to the workbook. You can do this by calling the `Add` method on the `CustomXmlParts` collection of the workbook.
```csharp
// Create four custom xml parts.
wb.CustomXmlParts.Add(btsData, btsSchema);
wb.CustomXmlParts.Add(btsData, btsSchema);
wb.CustomXmlParts.Add(btsData, btsSchema);
wb.CustomXmlParts.Add(btsData, btsSchema);
```
This code snippet adds four identical custom XML parts to the workbook. You can customize this as per your requirements.
## Step 4: Assign IDs to Custom XML Parts
Now that we have our XML parts added, let's give each of them a unique identifier. This ID will help us retrieve the XML parts later.
```csharp
// Assign ids to custom xml parts.
wb.CustomXmlParts[0].ID = "Fruit";
wb.CustomXmlParts[1].ID = "Color";
wb.CustomXmlParts[2].ID = "Sport";
wb.CustomXmlParts[3].ID = "Shape";
```
In this step, you are assigning meaningful IDs like "Fruit," "Color," "Sport," and "Shape." This makes it easy to identify and work with the respective parts afterwards.
## Step 5: Specify Search ID for Custom XML Part
When you want to retrieve a specific XML part using its ID, you need to define the ID you’re searching for.
```csharp
// Specify search custom xml part id.
String srchID = "Fruit";
srchID = "Color";
srchID = "Sport";
```
In a real application, you would likely want to specify each ID dynamically, but for our example, we're hardcoding a few.
## Step 6: Search for Custom XML Part by ID
Now that we have our search IDs, it’s time to look for the custom XML part corresponding to the specified ID.
```csharp
// Search custom xml part by the search id.
Aspose.Cells.Markup.CustomXmlPart cxp = wb.CustomXmlParts.SelectByID(srchID);
```
This line leverages `SelectByID` to attempt to find the XML part we are interested in.
## Step 7: Check If the Custom XML Part Was Found
Finally, we need to check whether the XML part was found and print an appropriate message to the console.
```csharp
// Print the found or not found message on console.
if (cxp == null)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Not Found: CustomXmlPart ID " + srchID);
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Found: CustomXmlPart ID " + srchID);
}
Console.WriteLine("AddCustomXMLPartsAndSelectThemByID executed successfully.");
```
You squashed it! By this point, you have not only added custom XML parts to your workbook but also implemented functionality to search for them by their IDs.
## Conclusion
In this article, we explored how to add custom XML parts to an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you were able to create a workbook, add custom XML parts, assign IDs, and retrieve them efficiently. This functionality can be incredibly useful when dealing with dynamic data that needs to be handled in Excel files, making your applications smarter and more capable. 
## FAQ's
