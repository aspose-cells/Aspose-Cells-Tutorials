# How to Load an Excel Workbook & Set Printer Sizes Using Aspose.Cells for .NET
## Introduction
Are you looking to generate reports from Excel data and customize them for specific printing requirements directly within your .NET application? This comprehensive guide will walk you through using the powerful **Aspose.Cells for .NET** library. You'll learn how to load workbooks from memory streams, set custom printer sizes such as A3 or A5, and export them to PDF format—all without leaving your development environment.

In this tutorial, you’ll discover:
- Loading an Excel workbook into a .NET application using Aspose.Cells.
- Techniques for setting various paper sizes for the final PDF output.
- Steps to save the modified workbook as a PDF with specified printer settings.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, ensure you have:
- **Aspose.Cells for .NET** library installed via NuGet.
- A basic understanding of C# and .NET applications.
- An IDE like Visual Studio that supports .NET development.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET
To start using Aspose.Cells, install the package in your project:
### .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```
### Package Manager
```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```
**License Acquisition:**
- **Free Trial:** Download a trial version to test features.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain one for extended evaluation purposes.
- **Purchase:** Buy a license for continued use.

### Basic Initialization
Create an instance of the `Workbook` class to begin working with Excel files. Ensure your application is properly licensed if you're using a purchased or temporary license:
```csharp
License license = new License();
license.SetLicense("Aspose.Cells.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide
Let's walk through implementing our feature step-by-step.
### Loading Workbook from Memory Stream and Setting Paper Size
#### Overview
This section demonstrates how to load an Excel workbook into memory and set custom printer sizes before exporting it as a PDF file.
##### Step 1: Create and Save Workbook in Memory
First, create a workbook with sample data and save it to a `MemoryStream`.
```csharp
string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Create a new workbook and worksheet
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
worksheet.Cells["P30"].PutValue("This is sample data.");

// Save to memory stream
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
workbook.Save(ms, SaveFormat.Xlsx);
ms.Position = 0;
```
##### Step 2: Load Workbook with Custom Paper Size
Load the workbook from the `MemoryStream` and set a specific paper size.
```csharp
// Set paper size to A5 and load the workbook
LoadOptions opts = new LoadOptions(LoadFormat.Xlsx);
opts.SetPaperSize(PaperSizeType.PaperA5);
workbook = new Workbook(ms, opts);

// Save as PDF with A5 setting
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputLoadWorkbookWithPrinterSize-A5.pdf");
```
##### Step 3: Change Paper Size and Export Again
Reset the stream position to load the workbook again with a different paper size.
```csharp
ms.Position = 0;

// Set paper size to A3 and reload
opts.SetPaperSize(PaperSizeType.PaperA3);
workbook = new Workbook(ms, opts);

// Save as PDF with A3 setting
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputLoadWorkbookWithPrinterSize-A3.pdf");
```
**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure `ms.Position` is reset to 0 before reloading the stream.
- Verify your file paths are correct when saving files.

## Practical Applications
This feature can be invaluable in various scenarios:
1. **Automated Report Generation:** Convert reports into PDFs with specific paper sizes for different departments automatically.
2. **Customized Invoice Printing:** Adjust printer settings based on client requirements before printing invoices.
3. **Document Archiving:** Standardize document formats and paper sizes during archival processes.

Integration possibilities include connecting this feature to enterprise systems where automated document handling is critical.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large datasets or high-frequency operations:
- Optimize memory usage by managing `MemoryStream` lifecycle effectively.
- Utilize Aspose.Cells’ efficient processing capabilities for complex workbooks.
- Follow best practices for garbage collection and resource management in .NET applications.

## Conclusion
You've learned how to load Excel workbooks from a memory stream, set custom printer sizes using Aspose.Cells for .NET, and export them as PDFs. This knowledge can significantly enhance your document processing workflows within a .NET environment.
To further explore Aspose.Cells' capabilities, consider diving into its extensive documentation or experimenting with other features like data manipulation and advanced formatting.
