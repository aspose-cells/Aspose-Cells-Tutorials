### Initialization and Setup

After installing Aspose.Cells, initialize it in your project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the steps to convert an Excel file into HTML.

### Creating a Workbook Object
**Overview:**
Start by creating a `Workbook` object, which is essential for manipulating Excel files.

**Step 1: Instantiate Workbook**
Create a new instance of the `Workbook` class:
```csharp
// ExStart:1
using Aspose.Cells;

namespace Aspose.Cells.Examples.CSharp.Files.Handling
{
    public class SaveInHtmlFormat
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            string dataDir = "your_directory_path";  // Specify your directory path

            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
**Why This Matters:**
The `Workbook` object represents the Excel file in memory, enabling various operations.

### Saving as HTML
**Overview:**
Convert and save the `Workbook` into an HTML format.

**Step 2: Save Workbook**
Use the `Save` method with the appropriate format:
```csharp
            workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.html", SaveFormat.Html);
        }
    }
}
// ExEnd:1
```
**Parameters Explained:**
- **`dataDir + "output.html"`**: The file path where your HTML will be saved.
- **`SaveFormat.Html`**: Specifies the format for saving, in this case, HTML.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure `dataDir` is correctly set to a valid directory path.
- If facing permission issues, verify read/write permissions on the specified path.

## Practical Applications

Understanding how Aspose.Cells can be used in real-world scenarios enhances its utility:
1. **Web Publishing:** Automatically convert data sheets for online display without manual intervention.
2. **Data Sharing:** Distribute reports and analytics as HTML documents across various platforms easily.
3. **Integration with CMS:** Seamlessly incorporate Excel-derived content into Content Management Systems.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large datasets, consider these tips:
- **Optimize Memory Usage:** Dispose of objects promptly to free memory.
- **Batch Processing:** Process files in batches rather than all at once for better resource management.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Streamline data processing logic to minimize overhead.
