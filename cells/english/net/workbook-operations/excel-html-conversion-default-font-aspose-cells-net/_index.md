## Implementation Guide

### Setting Default Font While Rendering

This feature ensures that an Excel workbook renders with a specific default font when converting to HTML. It's especially useful for handling cases where certain fonts might not be available on the target system.

#### Step 1: Create and Access Workbook

Create a new instance of `Workbook` and access its first worksheet:
```csharp
string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Create workbook object and access the first worksheet.
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

#### Step 2: Modify Cell Style

Access a specific cell, add text, and set the font to an unknown one for demonstration:
```csharp
// Access cell B4 and add some text inside it.
Cell cell = ws.Cells["B4"];
cell.PutValue("This text has some unknown or invalid font which does not exist.");

// Set the font of cell B4 to an unknown font.
Style st = cell.GetStyle();
st.Font.Name = "UnknownNotExist";
st.Font.Size = 20;
cell.SetStyle(st);
```

#### Step 3: Define HTML Save Options

Set the default font in your HTML output. Here, we demonstrate with three different fonts:

**Courier New:**
```csharp
// Save the workbook in HTML format with default font set to Courier New.
HtmlSaveOptions optsCourierNew = new HtmlSaveOptions();
optsCourierNew.DefaultFontName = "Courier New";
wb.Save(outputDir + "/out_courier_new_out.htm", optsCourierNew);
```

**Arial:**
```csharp
// Save the workbook in HTML format with default font set to Arial.
HtmlSaveOptions optsArial = new HtmlSaveOptions();
optsArial.DefaultFontName = "Arial";
wb.Save(outputDir + "/out_arial_out.htm", optsArial);
```

**Times New Roman:**
```csharp
// Save the workbook in HTML format with default font set to Times New Roman.
HtmlSaveOptions optsTimesNewRoman = new HtmlSaveOptions();
optsTimesNewRoman.DefaultFontName = "Times New Roman";
wb.Save(outputDir + "/times_new_roman_out.htm", optsTimesNewRoman);
```

### Workbook Creation and Cell Styling

This section covers creating a workbook, accessing worksheets, cells, and applying styles:

#### Step 1: Initialize Workbook
Create a new `Workbook` instance:
```csharp
// Create a workbook object.
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

#### Step 2: Access Worksheet and Cell
Access the first worksheet and cell B4 to add text and style it:
```csharp
// Access the first worksheet in the workbook.
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];

// Access cell B4 and add some text inside it.
Cell cell = ws.Cells["B4"];
cell.PutValue("This text has some unknown or invalid font which does not exist.");

// Set the font of cell B4 to an unknown font.
Style st = cell.GetStyle();
st.Font.Name = "UnknownNotExist";
st.Font.Size = 20;
cell.SetStyle(st);
```

## Practical Applications
- **Consistent Branding**: Ensure brand fonts are consistently applied in exported HTML documents.
- **Document Portability**: Handle scenarios where target environments lack specific fonts.
- **Automated Reporting**: Use this feature for generating automated reports with consistent typography.

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance:
- Manage memory usage by disposing of objects appropriately.
- Optimize rendering settings based on your application's needs.
- Regularly update to the latest Aspose.Cells version for improved features and bug fixes.

You've learned how to set a default font while converting Excel files to HTML using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This capability ensures consistent typography, even when certain fonts are unavailable in the target system. To further enhance your skills, explore additional features of Aspose.Cells and experiment with different rendering options.

**Next Steps**: Try implementing this solution in your projects and customize it to fit your specific needs.
