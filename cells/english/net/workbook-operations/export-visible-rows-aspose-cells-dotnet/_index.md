# How to Export Visible Excel Rows Using Aspose.Cells for .NET: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Working with large datasets in Excel can be overwhelming, especially when you need to focus on visible rows and include column headers for clarity. With **Aspose.Cells for .NET**, streamlining this process becomes straightforward. This guide demonstrates how to use Aspose.Cells to load an Excel workbook and export only its visible rows while including column names.

By the end of this guide, you'll know how to implement these features in your .NET applications using C#. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the code, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies

Workbook workbook = new Workbook("YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY/sampleExportVisibleRowsData.xlsx");
```

## Implementation Guide

This section guides you through exporting visible rows from an Excel worksheet using **Aspose.Cells for .NET**.

### Step 1: Load the Workbook and Access Worksheet

Load your Excel workbook and access its first worksheet:

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDir + "/sampleExportVisibleRowsData.xlsx");
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0]; // Access the first worksheet
```

### Step 2: Export Visible Rows with Options

Focus on exporting only visible rows and including column names:

```csharp
// Set export options to include only visible rows and headers
ExportTableOptions exportOptions = new ExportTableOptions();
exportOptions.PlotVisibleRows = true; // Include only visible rows
exportOptions.ExportColumnName = true; // Include column headers in the export

// Export a specified range of cells, starting at A1
DataTable dataTable = worksheet.Cells.ExportDataTable(0, 0, 10, 4, exportOptions);
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Paths**: Ensure file paths are correct to avoid loading errors.
- **Permissions**: Verify you have the necessary permissions to read/write Excel files in your environment.
