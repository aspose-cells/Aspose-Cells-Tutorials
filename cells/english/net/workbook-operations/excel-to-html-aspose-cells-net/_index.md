### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, include Aspose.Cells in your project and create a `Workbook` object with your Excel file:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

// Initialize workbook
Workbook wb = new Workbook("sample.xlsx");
```

## Implementation Guide
This section will walk you through converting an Excel file to HTML using Aspose.Cells.

### Step 1: Load the Excel File
Begin by loading your Excel document into a `Workbook` object. This step is crucial as it prepares your data for conversion.
```csharp
// Specify the path to your file
string filePath = "path/to/your/sample.xlsx";

// Create a workbook from the Excel file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(filePath);
```

### Step 2: Convert and Save as HTML
With the workbook loaded, you can now convert it into an HTML format. Aspose.Cells provides straightforward methods to accomplish this.
```csharp
// Define the output path for your HTML file
string outputPath = "path/to/output/ConvertingToHTMLFiles_out.html";

// Save the workbook in HTML format
wb.Save(outputPath, SaveFormat.Html);
```
**Explanation:**
- `SaveFormat.Html` specifies that you want to save the document as an HTML file.
- This method preserves the structure and styling of your Excel sheets.
