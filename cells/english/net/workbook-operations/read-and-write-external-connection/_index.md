# Read and Write External Connection of XLSB File

## Introduction

Are you working with Excel files and need to manage external connections? If you often find yourself tangled in data management, particularly with Excel files like XLSB, you're in for a treat. In this guide, we're diving deep into the capabilities of Aspose.Cells for .NET. We'll specifically explore how to read and write external connections in XLSB files. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a curious beginner, you'll find actionable insights here that can save you time and elevate your Excel management game. So, let’s roll up our sleeves and get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, let's make sure you have everything you need. Here’s a simple checklist of prerequisites to help you prepare:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have a running version of Visual Studio installed on your computer. You’ll be coding in C# as we work with Aspose.Cells.
   
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You’ll need the Aspose.Cells library. If you don't have it yet, you can easily [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). 

3. XLSB File: Have a sample XLSB file ready for testing. You can create one from Excel if you don’t have an existing one handy.

4. Basic Programming Knowledge: Some familiarity with C# will help you understand the code snippets we’ll explore.

Once you've ticked these off your list, we’re all set to dive into reading and modifying external connections within XLSB files!

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces. The following code snippet should be at the top of your C# file. These namespaces give you access to the Aspose.Cells functionality and help structure your application correctly.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
This step is crucial, as it allows you to leverage the powerful features of Aspose.Cells without cluttering your code.

## Step 1: Set Up Document Directories

First things first, we need to set up the directories where the input and output files will be stored. 

```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Example: "C:\\ExcelFiles\\"
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Example: "C:\\ExcelFiles\\"
```
Think of these directories as the storage closets where you keep your important files. You’ll refer to them throughout the process.

## Step 2: Load the XLSB File

Next, let’s load the XLSB file that contains our external connections. This is where the magic begins.

```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleExternalConnection_XLSB.xlsb");
```
Loading the workbook is similar to opening your favorite book – it gives you access to all the wonderful content inside. Just make sure you have the right file path!

## Step 3: Retrieve Database Connection

Now, we need to access the external connections present in the workbook. We’re particularly interested in the database connection.

```csharp
Aspose.Cells.ExternalConnections.DBConnection dbCon = wb.DataConnections[0] as Aspose.Cells.ExternalConnections.DBConnection;
```
Here, we’re asking the workbook to reveal its first data connection. Think of it like peeking under a lid to see what’s inside; you’re unearthing the database connection that may hold critical data.

## Step 4: Print Connection Details

Before making any changes, it’s a good idea to verify the current connection details by printing them out.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Connection Name: " + dbCon.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Command: " + dbCon.Command);
Console.WriteLine("Connection Info: " + dbCon.ConnectionInfo);
```
This helps you understand what you are working with. Imagine being handed the keys to a locked room before you decide to change the locks.

## Step 5: Modify the Connection Name

Now it's time for some action! Let’s change the name of the database connection to something more relevant.

```csharp
dbCon.Name = "NewCust";
```
This change is like giving your favorite plant a new name after you’ve repotted it. It helps you keep things organized and relevant.

## Step 6: Save the Modified XLSB File

Once you’ve made the necessary modifications, you need to save your changes back into the XLSB file.

```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputExternalConnection_XLSB.xlsb");
```
Think of saving your changes as locking the door after a home renovation – you want to make sure everything is secure and that your updates are preserved.

## Step 7: Confirmation Message

For peace of mind, let’s add a confirmation message to indicate that the process has completed successfully.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ReadAndWriteExternalConnectionOfXLSBFile executed successfully.\r\n");
```
This is like the cherry on top! It reassures you that the operation you’ve just executed has gone off without a hitch.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've navigated through the intricate process of reading and writing external connections in XLSB files using Aspose.Cells for .NET. From setting up the necessary directories and loading your workbooks to accessing, modifying, and saving connection details, you now have valuable skills at your fingertips. Aspose.Cells makes working with Excel a breeze, allowing you to focus more on data management and less on technical hiccups.
