# How to Export Excel to HTML with Grid Lines Using Aspose.Cells for .NET

## Introduction

Presenting your Excel data on the web while maintaining visual clarity can be challenging, especially when you need grid lines for better readability. With **Aspose.Cells for .NET**, exporting an entire workbook as an HTML file complete with grid lines becomes straightforward. This tutorial will guide you through using Aspose.Cells to achieve this functionality efficiently.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up and initializing Aspose.Cells in a .NET environment
- Step-by-step instructions on exporting a workbook to HTML while preserving grid lines
- Key configurations for customizing your export process
- Practical applications and integration possibilities

Before we dive into the implementation, let’s cover some prerequisites you’ll need.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial successfully, ensure you have:

1. **Aspose.Cells for .NET**: A powerful library that enables Excel file manipulation within .NET applications.
2. **Development Environment**: A compatible IDE such as Visual Studio installed on your machine is required.
3. **Knowledge Base**: Familiarity with C# and a basic understanding of HTML can be beneficial, though not strictly necessary.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To start using Aspose.Cells in your project, you’ll first need to install it. Here’s how you can add the package to your project:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```shell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

Once installed, you'll want to obtain a license. You have options for a free trial or purchasing a full license. To acquire a temporary license, follow the steps on [Aspose's website](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

### License Acquisition

1. **Free Trial**: Download and evaluate Aspose.Cells with limited functionalities.
2. **Temporary License**: For unrestricted access during development.
3. **Purchase**: Consider purchasing for long-term projects.

After setting up your license, you can initialize the library in your project as follows:

```csharp
// Initialize Aspose.Cells
var license = new Aspose.Cells.License();
license.SetLicense("Aspose.Cells.lic");
```

Now that we have everything set up, let's move on to implementing our feature.

## Implementation Guide

### Exporting Workbook to HTML with Grid Lines

In this section, we will focus on exporting a workbook and ensuring grid lines are included in the output HTML file.

#### Initializing Workbook and Worksheet

First, create a new `Workbook` object and access its first worksheet:

```csharp
// Create a new Workbook object
Workbook wb = new Workbook();

// Access the first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

#### Populating Data for Demonstration

To simulate a real-world scenario, let's fill the worksheet with sample data:

```csharp
// Fill the worksheet with integer values
for (int r = 0; r < 10; r++) {
    for (int c = 0; c < 10; c++) {
        ws.Cells[r, c].PutValue(r * 1);
    }
}
```

#### Configuring HTML Export Options

Set up the `HtmlSaveOptions` to include grid lines in your HTML output:

```csharp
// Set up HTML save options
HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
opts.ExportGridLines = true;
```

#### Saving as HTML with Grid Lines

Finally, save the workbook as an HTML file using the specified options:

```csharp
// Save the workbook to HTML with grid lines
wb.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/outputExportToHTMLWithGridLines.html", opts);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the output directory is correctly set and writable.
- Double-check your Aspose.Cells license setup if you encounter feature restrictions.

## Practical Applications

Exporting Excel workbooks to HTML with grid lines can be incredibly useful in various scenarios:

1. **Data Reporting**: Present detailed reports on web applications while maintaining visual structure.
2. **Educational Content**: Share data sets for academic purposes where grid lines enhance clarity.
3. **Business Analytics**: Display analytical results on internal dashboards or external websites.

Additionally, this feature can be integrated with other systems like CRM tools to present data dynamically in user interfaces.

## Performance Considerations

When working with Aspose.Cells, consider the following tips for optimal performance:

- Minimize memory usage by disposing of objects properly.
