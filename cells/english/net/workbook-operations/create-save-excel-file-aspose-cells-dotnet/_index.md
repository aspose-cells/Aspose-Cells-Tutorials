Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

### Removing Default Worksheet
Remove the default worksheet if it’s not needed:
```csharp
// Remove the default worksheet that is created when a new workbook is instantiated
workbook.Worksheets.RemoveAt(0);
```

### Adding and Naming Multiple Sheets
Add five worksheets to your workbook and name them sequentially.
```csharp
// Add 5 worksheets and name them
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    Worksheet ws = workbook.Worksheets[workbook.Worksheets.Add()];
    ws.Name = "Sheet" + (i + 1).ToString();
}
```

### Populating Sheets with Data
Fill each worksheet with data in a grid.
```csharp
// Populate sheets with data
for (int i = 0; i < workbook.Worksheets.Count; i++) {
    Worksheet ws = workbook.Worksheets[i];
    for (int row = 0; row < 150; row++) {
        for (int col = 0; col < 56; col++) {
            ws.Cells[row, col].PutValue($"row{row} col{col}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Saving the Workbook
Save your workbook to a specified directory.
```csharp
// Save the workbook
string outputFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputDir, "ACellsSample_out.xlsx");
workbook.Save(outputFilePath);
```
