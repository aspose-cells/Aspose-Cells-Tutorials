# Allow Leading Apostrophe in Workbook using Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
Data management has crossed tons of boundaries, evolving from traditional methods to using robust libraries that streamline the way we work with data. One such powerful tool is Aspose.Cells for .NET. This library helps developers manage Excel files with incredible ease and flexibility. If you’ve ever tried working with leading apostrophes in Excel, you know how tricky it can get! Well, this article is designed to show you how to allow leading apostrophes in your workbook using Aspose.Cells. So, if you’re curious about how to enhance your Excel documents smartly, let’s dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, let’s make sure you’re well-prepped. Here’s what you’ll need to have in your toolkit:
1. Visual Studio: Having this installed on your system is crucial since you’ll be writing and running C# code to implement Aspose.Cells functionalities.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You’ll want to have this library at your disposal. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A little understanding of C# programming will go a long way. If you're familiar with data structures, you're already ahead of the game.
4. .NET Framework: Make sure you have .NET Framework installed on your system to ensure compatibility with Aspose.Cells.
## Import Packages
Once you've got everything set up and ready, the next step is importing the necessary packages. Here’s how you can do that effectively:
### Create a New Project
Start by creating a new C# project in Visual Studio. This will act as your workspace.
### Install Aspose.Cells
1. Go to the NuGet Package Manager within your Visual Studio project.
2. Search for “Aspose.Cells”.
3. Click “Install” to add the package to your project.
### Import the Namespace
Add the following line at the top of your code file to use the Aspose.Cells library:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells.Rendering;
using Aspose.Cells.WebExtensions;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```
That’s it! You’re all set up to start manipulating Excel documents with Aspose.Cells.

Now that you’ve imported the necessary packages, let's walk through a detailed step-by-step guide on how to allow leading apostrophes in an Excel workbook.
## Step 1: Define Your Data Structure
First, you’ll need a data structure to hold your sample data. In this case, we’re going for a simple class that represents a data object.
```csharp
internal class DataObject
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
This will enable you to create instances of your data easily.
## Step 2: Set Up Source and Output Directories
Next, you need to define where your source Excel file is located and where you want to save your output file. Adjust these paths according to your file structure.
```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 3: Create a WorkbookDesigner Object
The `WorkbookDesigner` class is pivotal for processing smart markers in your workbook. Here’s how you can instantiate it:
```csharp
WorkbookDesigner designer = new WorkbookDesigner();
```
## Step 4: Load the Workbook
Now it’s time to load your workbook from the specified source directory. Ensure you have an Excel file named `AllowLeadingApostropheSample.xlsx` in that directory.
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "AllowLeadingApostropheSample.xlsx");
workbook.Settings.QuotePrefixToStyle = false;
```
Setting `QuotePrefixToStyle` to false allows leading apostrophes to be treated correctly. 
## Step 5: Assign the Workbook to Designer
You then need to link your workbook to the `WorkbookDesigner` object you created earlier.
```csharp
designer.Workbook = workbook;
```
## Step 6: Create Sample Data
Here’s where the magic happens! You’re going to create a list of `DataObject` instances—one with a regular name and another that includes a leading apostrophe. 
```csharp
List<DataObject> list = new List<DataObject>
{
    new DataObject { Id = 1, Name = "demo" },
    new DataObject { Id = 2, Name = "'demo" }
};
```
This simulates your data inputs, showing you how the library will handle the leading apostrophe.
## Step 7: Set the Data Source
Next, set this list as the data source for your `WorkbookDesigner`.
```csharp
designer.SetDataSource("sampleData", list);
```
## Step 8: Process the Smart Markers
Now comes the exciting part—process your smart markers!
```csharp
designer.Process();
```
This step takes your data input and integrates it into your workbook.
## Step 9: Save the Output
Finally, save your output Excel file to the specified output directory:
```csharp
designer.Workbook.Save(outputDir + "AllowLeadingApostropheSample_out.xlsx");
```
## Step 10: Confirmation Message
Wrap it all up with a simple console message to let you know the process is complete.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("AllowLeadingApostrophe executed successfully.");
```
## Conclusion
And there you have it! With just a few steps, you can allow leading apostrophes in your Excel workbooks using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This library not only simplifies your Excel operations but also empowers you to handle your data more intelligently.
With this newfound skill, you can ensure your Excel files portray information accurately, even with quirky elements like leading apostrophes. So go ahead and give your spreadsheets the attention they deserve!
