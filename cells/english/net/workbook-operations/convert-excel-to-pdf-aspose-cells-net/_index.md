# Convert Excel Workbooks to Styled PDFs Using Aspose.Cells for .NET

## Introduction

Converting Excel workbooks to PDF while maintaining the integrity of their presentation can be challenging, especially when preserving fonts, styles, and special characters. This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to use **Aspose.Cells for .NET** to create and style an Excel workbook before converting it into a PDF document with specific styling options.

### What You'll Learn
- Setting up Aspose.Cells in your .NET project.
- Creating and styling an Excel workbook using C#.
- Saving Excel workbooks as PDFs, with or without font substitution options.

Let's review the prerequisites before getting started!

## Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries
- **Aspose.Cells for .NET**: Essential for manipulating Excel files and converting them to formats like PDF. Install via NuGet.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment with .NET (preferably .NET Core or .NET 5/6).

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C#.
- Familiarity with Excel, workbooks, worksheets, and cells is helpful but not required.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To work with **Aspose.Cells**, add it to your project using the following methods:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```plaintext
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

### License Acquisition
Aspose offers a free trial to evaluate the library before purchase. For extended use, apply for a temporary license or purchase a full one.
1. **Free Trial**: Download from [Aspose Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
2. **Temporary License**: Apply at [Aspose Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase**: Buy directly on their site at [Aspose Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization
Once installed, initialize Aspose.Cells in your application:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

// Initialize a new Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

## Implementation Guide
We'll break down the implementation into key features for clarity.

### Feature 1: Create and Style Workbook
This feature demonstrates creating an Excel workbook, accessing its worksheet, and applying font styles using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

#### Step 1: Initialize Workbook
Start by creating a new `Workbook` object:
```csharp
string sourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Create workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

#### Step 2: Access and Style Worksheet Cells
Access the first worksheet, retrieve cells, and apply styles:
```csharp
// Access the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Access cells A1 and B1
Cell cell1 = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
Cell cell2 = worksheet.Cells["B1"];

// Set font style to Times New Roman for both cells
Style style = cell1.GetStyle();
style.Font.Name = "Times New Roman";
cell1.SetStyle(style);
cell2.SetStyle(style);

// Add values, including a non-breaking hyphen in B1
cell1.PutValue("Hello without Non-Breaking Hyphen");
cell2.PutValue("Hello" + Convert.ToChar(8209) + " with Non-Breaking Hyphen");

// Autofit columns to content size
worksheet.AutoFitColumns();
```
**Key Considerations**: 
- **Font Styling**: Proper font settings enhance readability and professionalism.
- **Non-breaking Characters**: Use `Convert.ToChar(8209)` for non-breaking hyphens, preventing line breaks at undesired points.

### Feature 2: Save Workbook to PDF Without Character Substitution Options
This section shows saving an Excel workbook as a PDF without font substitution options.
```csharp
// Create workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

// Save the workbook to PDF
workbook.Save(outputDir + "/SampleOutput_out.pdf");
```
**Explanation**: This method preserves original fonts where possible, ideal for documents requiring font integrity.

### Feature 3: Save Workbook to PDF With Character Substitution Options
For more control over font substitution during conversion:
```csharp
// Create workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

// Initialize PdfSaveOptions with font substitution granularity enabled
PdfSaveOptions opts = new PdfSaveOptions();
opts.IsFontSubstitutionCharGranularity = true;

// Save the workbook to PDF with these options
workbook.Save(outputDir + "/SampleOutput2_out.pdf", opts);
```
**Key Configuration**: Enabling `IsFontSubstitutionCharGranularity` allows finer control over font substitution, crucial for documents needing specific character representation.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Fonts**: Ensure all workbook fonts are installed on your system.
- **Incorrect Paths**: Verify source and output directories exist with appropriate permissions.

## Practical Applications
1. **Financial Reporting**: Convert financial reports from Excel to PDF, maintaining styling for distribution.
2. **Educational Material**: Generate styled worksheets as PDFs, ensuring consistent presentation across platforms.
3. **Business Proposals**: Create professional-looking proposals by converting detailed spreadsheets into PDF documents.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance with Aspose.Cells can lead to more efficient applications:
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of workbook objects promptly to free resources.
- **Large Files Handling**: For large workbooks, consider breaking down tasks or optimizing data storage formats.

Best practices include using `using` statements where applicable and reviewing resource usage patterns periodically.

## Conclusion
This tutorial guided you through creating and styling Excel workbooks with Aspose.Cells for .NET, converting them to PDFs while managing font substitution. By following these steps, your data presentation workflow can be significantly enhanced.

### Next Steps
- Experiment with different styles and formats within your workbook.
- Explore other Aspose.Cells features such as chart conversion or data import/export.

**Call-to-Action**: Implement these techniques in your next project to see the difference they make!

## FAQ Section
