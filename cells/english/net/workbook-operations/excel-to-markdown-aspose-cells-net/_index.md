## Implementation Guide

Here's how to convert an Excel file into markdown using Aspose.Cells:

### Step 1: Open the Excel File
Load your Excel file with the `Workbook` class for easy data access.

```csharp
// Load the Excel file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook("sourcePath\\Book1.xlsx");
```
**Explanation**: This code creates an instance of the `Workbook` class and loads an Excel file from a specified path.

### Step 2: Convert to Markdown
Save your loaded workbook in markdown format using the `Save` method.

```csharp
// Define output directory and convert
workbook.Save("outputPath\\Book1.md", SaveFormat.Markdown);
```
**Explanation**: The `Save` method takes two parameters—the file path for storing the markdown and the desired save format. Here, `SaveFormat.Markdown` specifies markdown format.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found Error**: Double-check your file paths.
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure your application has write access to the output directory.
