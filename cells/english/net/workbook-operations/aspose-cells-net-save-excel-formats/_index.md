Workbook workbook = new Workbook(filePath);
```

**Step 2: Save as XLS or XLSX**
```csharp
// Specify the output directory and save in Excel 97-2003 format.
workbook.Save("output.xls");

// Alternatively, save in XLSX format for modern compatibility.
workbook.Save("output.xlsx");
```

### Saving as PDF
