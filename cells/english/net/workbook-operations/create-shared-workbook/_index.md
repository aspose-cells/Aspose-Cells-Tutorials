# Create Shared Workbook using Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive guide on how to create a shared workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET! If you've ever needed to collaborate on Excel files with ease, then a shared workbook is a fantastic solution. In this article, we will walk you through the steps of creating a shared workbook, breaking down each step in detail. Whether you are a beginner or someone looking to refine your skills, this tutorial has you covered. So, let’s dive in, shall we?
## Prerequisites
Before we get started with creating a shared workbook, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:
1. Basic Knowledge of .NET: Understanding the basics of .NET programming will help you grasp the concepts of this tutorial more easily.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: You should have the Aspose.Cells library installed in your .NET project. You can download it from the [site](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Development Environment: Ensure that you are working in a suitable development environment, such as Visual Studio.
4. A Valid License: While you can start with a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/), be mindful that using it for long-term projects may require purchasing a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
With these prerequisites checked off, you're ready to create your shared workbook!
## Import Packages
To get started with Aspose.Cells, you'll need to import the relevant packages into your .NET project. Here’s how to do it:
### Open Your .NET Project
First, open your .NET project in your preferred development environment like Visual Studio.
### Access NuGet Package Manager
Use the NuGet Package Manager to add Aspose.Cells to your project. You can do this by right-clicking on your project in Solution Explorer and selecting "Manage NuGet Packages."
### Search for Aspose.Cells
In the Browse tab, type "Aspose.Cells" in the search bar. You should see the library appear in the results.
### Install the Package
Click on the "Install" button, and follow any prompts that appear. This will add the Aspose.Cells library to your project, allowing you to utilize its features.
### Add the Necessary Using Directives
In your .NET file, be sure to add the relevant directive at the top:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
Okay, now that we’ve set everything up, let’s share that workbook!
Now, we are going to create a shared workbook step by step. Let’s break it down!
## Step 1: Define the Output Directory
First, you need to specify where you want the shared workbook to be saved. You can do this by declaring a string variable as your output directory.
```csharp
//Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Create a Workbook Object
In this step, we will create an instance of the `Workbook` class. This object will be your working file.
```csharp
//Create Workbook object
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
## Step 3: Set Workbook to Shared
Next, we need to set the workbook to be shared. This is done by accessing the workbook's settings and changing the shared property to true.
```csharp
//Share the Workbook
wb.Settings.Shared = true;
```
## Step 4: Save the Shared Workbook
Now comes the exciting part! You will save your shared workbook using the `Save` method. Make sure to provide the full path to the file as per your output directory.
```csharp
//Save the Shared Workbook
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputSharedWorkbook.xlsx");
```
## Step 5: Confirm Action Success
Finally, let’s confirm that everything ran smoothly by printing a success message to the console.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("CreateSharedWorkbook executed successfully.\r\n");
```
And there you have it! With just a few lines of code, you’ve successfully created a shared workbook using Aspose.Cells.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we broke down the process of creating a shared workbook into digestible steps, using Aspose.Cells for .NET. From setting up your development environment to writing the actual code, you’ve learned how to create a collaborative Excel file that can be shared among multiple users.
Collaborating with shared workbooks makes life so much easier, doesn’t it? Just think of it like passing around a notebook in class; everyone can jot down their notes without losing the original copy!
