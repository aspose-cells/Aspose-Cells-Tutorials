# Load HTML into Excel with Autofit Using Aspose.Cells for .NET

## Introduction

Are you looking to convert HTML tables into Excel workbooks while maintaining optimal formatting? This guide walks you through loading HTML content directly into an Aspose.Cells workbook, complete with autofit options. By leveraging this feature, developers can transform and manage data in Excel efficiently without manual adjustments.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Load HTML strings into an Aspose.Cells Workbook.
- Utilize Autofit columns and rows for enhanced readability.
- Apply these techniques to business reporting and data analysis.
- Optimize performance for .NET applications.

## Prerequisites

Ensure your development environment is ready before starting:

- **Required Libraries:** You'll need the Aspose.Cells for .NET library. Confirm compatibility with your project version.
- **Environment Setup:** Use Visual Studio or any IDE supporting .NET development.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** A basic understanding of C# and familiarity with Excel data manipulation is required.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

### Installation

To get started, install the Aspose.Cells library using either the .NET CLI or Package Manager:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Package Manager:**
```plaintext
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Load HTML into Workbook

This feature demonstrates how to load an HTML string into a workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

#### Overview
The code converts an HTML table into a `MemoryStream`, which is then loaded as a `Workbook` object in Excel format.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Step 1:** Define your source directory and HTML content.
```csharp
string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string sampleHtml = "<html><body><table><tr><td>This is sample text.</td><td>Some text.</td></tr><tr><td>This is another sample text.</td><td>Some text.</td></tr></table></body></html>";
```
**Step 2:** Convert the HTML string to a `MemoryStream`.
```csharp
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sampleHtml));
```
**Step 3:** Load the memory stream into an Aspose.Cells `Workbook` object.
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(ms);
```
**Step 4:** Save the workbook in XLSX format.
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
wb.Save(Path.Combine(outputDir, "outputWithout_AutoFitColsAndRows.xlsx"));
```

### Feature 2: Load HTML into Workbook with AutoFit Columns and Rows

Enhance the previous functionality by autofitting columns and rows for better presentation.

#### Overview
This extension uses `HtmlLoadOptions` to automatically adjust column widths and row heights based on content size.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Step 1:** Reuse your source directory and HTML content definitions from Feature 1.
**Step 2:** Convert the HTML string into a `MemoryStream`.
```csharp
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sampleHtml));
```
**Step 3:** Create `HtmlLoadOptions` with autofit settings enabled.
```csharp
HtmlLoadOptions opts = new HtmlLoadOptions();
opts.AutoFitColsAndRows = true;
```
**Step 4:** Load the memory stream into a Workbook object using specified options.
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(ms, opts);
```
**Step 5:** Save the workbook with autofit adjustments applied.
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
wb.Save(Path.Combine(outputDir, "outputWith_AutoFitColsAndRows.xlsx"));
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** Incorrect directory paths. Ensure `SourceDir` and `OutputDir` are set correctly.
- **MemoryStream Errors:** Confirm the HTML string is properly encoded in UTF-8.

## Practical Applications

This feature can be applied in various scenarios:
1. **Data Migration:** Convert web-scraped data tables into Excel reports for analysis.
2. **Financial Reporting:** Automatically format financial statements extracted from HTML sources.
3. **Inventory Management:** Streamline inventory lists formatted as HTML into structured Excel files.
4. **Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** Import customer data into CRM systems using well-formatted spreadsheets.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimizing Memory Usage:** Use `MemoryStream` effectively and release resources promptly to manage memory efficiently.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Process only necessary parts of HTML content when loading large datasets.
- **Best Practices:** Regularly update the Aspose.Cells library to leverage performance improvements and new features.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to load HTML into an Aspose.Cells workbook with and without autofit options. This functionality streamlines data processing tasks, making Excel a powerful tool for handling dynamic content directly from web sources.

Next steps include exploring more features of the Aspose.Cells library, such as advanced styling, formula calculations, or integrating this solution into larger applications.
