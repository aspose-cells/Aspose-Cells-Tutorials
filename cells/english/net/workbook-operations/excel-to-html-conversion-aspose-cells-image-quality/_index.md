## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Setting Image Preferences for HTML Conversion

This feature focuses on enhancing image quality when converting Excel spreadsheets to HTML format.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths

First, specify the paths for your source and output directories:

```csharp
string SourceDir = @"YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string OutputDir = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Load Your Spreadsheet

Load the spreadsheet file you intend to convert:

```csharp
Workbook book = new Workbook($"{SourceDir}/Book1.xlsx");
```

#### Step 3: Configure HTML Save Options

Create an instance of `HtmlSaveOptions` and configure image settings:

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Html);
// Set the Image Format to PNG for better quality
saveOptions.ImageOptions.ImageType = Drawing.ImageType.Png;
// Enable AntiAlias to smooth images and text
saveOptions.ImageOptions.SmoothingMode = SmoothingMode.AntiAlias;
saveOptions.ImageOptions.TextRenderingHint = TextRenderingHint.AntiAlias;
```

#### Step 4: Save the Converted HTML

Finally, save your workbook as an HTML file with these settings:

```csharp
book.Save($"{OutputDir}/output.html", saveOptions);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Image Quality Issues**: Ensure `SmoothingMode` is set to `AntiAlias`.
- **File Not Found Errors**: Double-check the source and output directory paths.
