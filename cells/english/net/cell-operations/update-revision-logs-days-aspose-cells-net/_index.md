# How to Update Days Preserving History of Revision Logs in Shared Workbooks using Aspose.Cells .NET

## Introduction

Managing revision logs effectively is crucial when working with shared workbooks, especially when multiple users are collaborating on the same document. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to update the number of days that revision history is preserved in a shared workbook. This functionality helps maintain an accurate and up-to-date record of changes without cluttering your logs with outdated information.

**What You'll Learn:**

- How to set up Aspose.Cells for .NET.
- Implementing the feature to preserve revision log history.
- Configuring settings for optimal performance.
- Understanding practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Let's dive into the prerequisites before we begin implementing this solution.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies

To follow along with this tutorial, ensure you have:

- **Aspose.Cells for .NET**: At least version 21.1 or later.
- A compatible .NET environment (e.g., .NET Core 3.1 or later).

### Environment Setup Requirements

Ensure your development environment is set up to run C# applications. You'll need either Visual Studio or the .NET CLI installed on your system.

### Knowledge Prerequisites

A basic understanding of C# and familiarity with handling Excel files programmatically will be beneficial for this tutorial.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To start using Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can add it to your project via NuGet. Hereâ€™s how:

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**

```powershell
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

### License Acquisition

Aspose.Cells offers a free trial with limited capabilities, allowing you to test its features. For full access, consider purchasing a license or obtaining a temporary one for evaluation purposes. Visit the [purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) for more details.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup

Start by creating an instance of `Workbook` which represents your Excel file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

// Initialize the workbook object
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Days to Preserve History in Shared Workbooks

In shared workbooks, keeping track of revisions is essential for collaborative editing. With Aspose.Cells, you can specify how long these logs should be preserved.

#### Creating and Configuring a Shared Workbook

**Step 1: Create an Empty Workbook**

```csharp
// Create a new workbook instance
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

**Step 2: Share the Workbook**

Enable sharing to allow multiple users to edit:

```csharp
// Enable shared settings
wb.Settings.Shared = true;
```

**Step 3: Update DaysPreservingHistory of RevisionLogs**

Specify how many days you want to preserve revision history:

```csharp
// Set days for preserving revision logs
wb.Worksheets.RevisionLogs.DaysPreservingHistory = 7;
```

This setting ensures that only the last seven days of changes are recorded, keeping your logs concise and relevant.

**Step 4: Save the Workbook**

Finally, save the workbook with the updated settings:

```csharp
// Define output directory
string outputDir = RunExamples.Get_OutputDirectory();

// Save the file
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputShared_DaysPreservingHistory.xlsx");
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Ensure Workbook is Shared**: If changes don't reflect, verify that `wb.Settings.Shared` is set to true.
- **Check Days Value**: Ensure `DaysPreservingHistory` is a positive integer.

## Practical Applications

1. **Collaborative Projects**: Ideal for teams working on dynamic projects where frequent updates are necessary.
2. **Version Control Systems**: Integrating with version control systems like Git to maintain an organized change log.
3. **Automated Reporting Tools**: Useful in scenarios where automated tools generate reports based on shared workbooks.

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Use Aspose.Cells' memory-efficient methods, especially when handling large datasets.
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Disable unnecessary features to streamline performance.
- **Best Practices**: Regularly update to the latest version of Aspose.Cells for optimal efficiency and bug fixes.
