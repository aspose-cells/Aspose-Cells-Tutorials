# Display or Hide Scroll Bars in Worksheet

## Introduction
When working with Excel files in .NET applications, having control over the display settings is crucial for providing a clean and user-friendly interface. One frequently useful feature is the ability to show or hide scroll bars in your worksheets. In this tutorial, we’ll dig into how to display or hide scroll bars in a worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you’re crafting a simple Excel report or a complex data analysis tool, mastering these settings can significantly enhance the user experience.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the code, there are a few prerequisites you’ll need to ensure you have in place:
1. Basic Knowledge of C# and .NET: Familiarity with programming concepts in C# and the .NET framework will make following along much easier.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: You must have the Aspose.Cells library installed in your project. You can download the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Development Environment: Make sure you have a suitable development environment set up, like Visual Studio, where you can write and test your C# code.
4. An Excel File: You should have an existing Excel file to work with. For this tutorial, we’ll be using a file named `book1.xls`. Place this in your project or the directory you’ll be working from.
Let’s jump into the meat of the tutorial!
## Import Packages
The first step to any Aspose.Cells project involves importing the necessary namespaces. This allows our application to access the functionality provided by the Aspose.Cells library. Below is how you can do this in C#:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
Make sure to add these using directives at the top of your C# file.
Now, let’s break down the process into simple, digestible steps to hide the scroll bars in a worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET.
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Data Directory
First things first, we need to specify where our Excel files are located. This is where you’ll direct the application to find `book1.xls`.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Update this path!
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where you have `book1.xls` stored. This can be a local drive path or a network location, just ensure it is correct.
## Step 2: Creating a File Stream
Next, we’ll create a file stream to access our Excel file. Here’s how you do this:
```csharp
// Creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(dataDir + "book1.xls", FileMode.Open);
```
This code opens `book1.xls` for reading, giving us the ability to manipulate its contents.
## Step 3: Instantiating a Workbook
Once we have our file stream ready, we now need to instantiate a `Workbook` object, which will allow us to interact with the content of our Excel file.
```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
// Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
```
The `Workbook` object loads the contents of the Excel file, making it ready for further modifications.
## Step 4: Hiding the Vertical Scroll Bar
Now let’s tackle hiding the vertical scroll bar. This is as simple as setting a property on the `workbook.Settings` object.
```csharp
// Hiding the vertical scroll bar of the Excel file
workbook.Settings.IsVScrollBarVisible = false;
```
With this line of code, we tell the application to hide the vertical scroll bar. Nothing will be more annoying than unnecessary scroll bars when viewing your data!
## Step 5: Hiding the Horizontal Scroll Bar
But wait, we’re not done yet! Let's hide the horizontal scroll bar as well. You guessed it, it’s the same approach:
```csharp
// Hiding the horizontal scroll bar of the Excel file
workbook.Settings.IsHScrollBarVisible = false;
```
With this, you ensure an uncluttered view on both axes of your Excel sheet.
## Step 6: Saving the Modified Excel File
After making changes, it’s time to save our modified Excel file. We’ll need to specify the output file name and its directory.
```csharp
// Saving the modified Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
This saves your new Excel file as `output.xls`, reflecting the changes you have made.
## Step 7: Closing the File Stream
Finally, to keep your application resource-efficient, remember to close the file stream. This prevents memory leaks and other issues.
```csharp
// Closing the file stream to free all resources
fstream.Close();
```
And there you go! You've completed the steps to hide both scroll bars in an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we walked you through a simplistic yet powerful operation in handling Excel documents with Aspose.Cells for .NET. By controlling the visibility of scroll bars, you create a tidier and more professional interface for your users. This might seem like a small detail, but like the proverbial cherry on top, it can make a significant difference in user experience.
