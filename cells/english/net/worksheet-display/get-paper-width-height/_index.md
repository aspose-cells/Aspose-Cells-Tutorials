# Get Paper Width and Height for Worksheet Printing

## Introduction
Printing documents accurately requires knowledge of the paper's dimensions. If you're a developer or working on an application that deals with Excel files, you might need to know how to get the paper width and height when printing worksheets. Fortunately, Aspose.Cells for .NET provides a robust way to manage Excel documents programmatically. In this article, we’ll guide you through the process of determining paper size specifics, using simple examples to illustrate fundamental concepts. 
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the technical details, let’s get some groundwork laid out. To successfully follow along with this tutorial, you will need:
### 1. Basic Knowledge of C#
You should have a good grasp of C# programming, as we will be working within a .NET environment.
### 2. Aspose.Cells Library
Ensure that you have the Aspose.Cells library installed in your project. If you haven't done it yet, you can download the latest version from the [Aspose.Cells download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
### 3. Visual Studio IDE
It's beneficial to have Visual Studio to run and manage your C# projects. Any version that supports .NET should work great.
### 4. A Valid Aspose License
While Aspose.Cells can be trialed, consider purchasing a license if you’re using it for long-term projects. You can buy it through [this link](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or explore a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for short testing phases.
Once you're all set, let's get into the code!
## Importing Packages
The first step in our journey involves importing essential namespaces. This is crucial, as it lets us access the classes and methods we’ll be using to manipulate Excel files. Here’s how you do it:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
Make sure to include this line at the top of your .cs file. Now that we’ve got the imports ready, let’s proceed with creating our workbook and accessing the worksheet.
## Step 1: Create Your Workbook
We start by creating an instance of the `Workbook` class. This forms the foundation of our Excel file manipulation.
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
This line tells the program to initialize a new workbook, setting us up to dive into our worksheets.
## Step 2: Access the First Worksheet
Next, we’ll access the first worksheet in our newly created workbook. It's pretty straightforward:
```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
Here, we’re accessing the first sheet (indexed at 0) in our workbook. This is where we’ll be setting the paper sizes.
## Setting Paper Size and Retrieving Dimensions
Now we're entering the core of the operation—setting the paper size and retrieving its dimensions! Let’s break this down step-by-step.
## Step 3: Set Paper Size to A2
Let’s first set our paper size to A2 and print out its dimensions.
```csharp
ws.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperA2;
Console.WriteLine("PaperA2: " + ws.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + ws.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```
After this setup, we use `Console.WriteLine` to display the dimensions. When you run this, you’ll see the width and height in inches for A2 paper size.
## Step 4: Set Paper Size to A3
Now it’s time for A3! We simply repeat the process:
```csharp
ws.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperA3;
Console.WriteLine("PaperA3: " + ws.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + ws.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```
Voila! The declaration will print the specific height and width for A3 paper.
## Step 5: Set Paper Size to A4
Following the same pattern, let’s check how A4 measures up:
```csharp
ws.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperA4;
Console.WriteLine("PaperA4: " + ws.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + ws.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```
This gets us the dimensions for A4—one of the most commonly used paper sizes.
## Step 6: Set Paper Size to Letter
To round out our paper size exploration, let’s set it to Letter size:
```csharp
ws.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperLetter;
Console.WriteLine("PaperLetter: " + ws.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + ws.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```
Again, we’ll see the specific width and height for Letter size.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve just learned how to get the paper width and height for various sizes when preparing worksheets for printing using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This utility can be incredibly helpful, especially when you're planning your printing layouts or managing print settings programmatically. By knowing the exact dimensions in inches, you can avoid common pitfalls and ensure that your documents print out as intended.
