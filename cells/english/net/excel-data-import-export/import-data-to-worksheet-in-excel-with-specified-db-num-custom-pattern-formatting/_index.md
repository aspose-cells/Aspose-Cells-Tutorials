# Import Data to Excel with Custom DB Num Pattern Formatting

## Introduction

When it comes to spreadsheet manipulation, importing data into Excel and formatting it correctly can feel like an overwhelming task, especially when you want to use specific culture-based formats such as DB Num patterns. If you’ve ever felt bogged down by the technicalities of Excel formatting, you’re in the right place! In this guide, we’re going to break things down into simple steps using Aspose.Cells for .NET, making your data imports not only straightforward but also aesthetically pleasing. So, hold tight because we’re diving right into the world of .NET programming, formatting, and exporting Excel files with ease!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, let’s make sure you have everything you need. Here’s a quick checklist of prerequisites to set you up for success:

1. .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed on your machine. Aspose.Cells works seamlessly with various .NET versions.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You’ll need to download and install the Aspose.Cells library. You can grab it from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use an IDE like Visual Studio where you can write and execute your C# code.
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: Having a foundational understanding of C# will help you follow along with the coding practices we’ll use in this guide.

Got everything? Great! Let’s move on to importing the necessary packages.

## Import Packages

To work effectively with Aspose.Cells, you need to import the required namespaces at the beginning of your C# file. Let’s break it down step by step.

### Create Your C# File

Open your IDE (Visual Studio is recommended) and create a new C# project. Name it something relevant like `ExcelDataImport`.

### Reference Aspose.Cells

You must include the Aspose.Cells library in your project. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select ‘Add Reference’. Browse to where you installed Aspose.Cells and select it.

### Import Necessary Namespaces

At the top of your C# file, import the following namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
```

This simple line is your gateway to all the functionality Aspose.Cells has to offer. 

Now that we have all the prerequisites covered and have imported the necessary packages, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of importing data to Excel and applying custom DB Num pattern formatting. We’ll take this methodically to ensure clarity and understanding.

## Step 1: Set the Data Directory

Firstly, you need to specify the path to your documents directory where the output will be saved. Adjust this according to your file structure.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

In this example, replace `Your Document Directory` with your actual path, like `C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\`.

## Step 2: Create a Workbook

Next, you’ll create a new workbook, which is essentially your Excel file.

```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

Here, we’re instantiating a new `Workbook` object. This is your blank canvas!

## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet

Each workbook contains multiple worksheets. You’ll want to access the first worksheet to begin inputting data.

```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

Just like flipping open a book to the first page, you’re accessing the first worksheet to add your data.

## Step 4: Input Data into a Cell

Now, let’s populate a cell with some data. For this example, we’ll input the value `123` into cell A1.

```csharp
Cell cell = ws.Cells["A1"];
cell.PutValue(123);
```

You're directly speaking to Excel here—putting data right into cell A1! 

## Step 5: Access the Cell Style

Every cell has a style, and you can customize how it looks. To apply a custom format, first, you need to access the cell's style.

```csharp
Style st = cell.GetStyle();
```

By grabbing the cell's style, you're preparing to add your unique touch!

## Step 6: Specify DBNum Custom Pattern Formatting

Here’s where the magic happens. You can specify a custom format pattern using the DBNum formatting style.

```csharp
st.Custom = "[DBNum2][$-804]General";
```

This line tells Excel to format the number `123` according to the DBNum pattern corresponding to the Chinese language. Pretty neat, right?

## Step 7: Set the Updated Cell Style

Now that you’ve defined your custom style, it’s time to apply it to the cell.

```csharp
cell.SetStyle(st);
```

This is like dressing up your cell in a stylish new outfit!

## Step 8: Adjust Column Width

Let’s make sure everything looks nice and neat. You can adjust the width of the first column to better fit your data.

```csharp
ws.Cells.SetColumnWidth(0, 30);
```

Here, we’re expanding the column width, so your data doesn’t feel cramped. Think of it like giving your data space to breathe!

## Step 9: Save the Workbook

Finally, let’s save this masterpiece to a PDF format. This is the grand finale!

```csharp
wb.Save(dataDir + "outputDBNumCustomFormatting.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
```

Congratulations! You’ve just created a PDF file showcasing your number formatted with DB Num styles.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve successfully imported data into Excel, applied custom DB Num formatting, and saved it in PDF format. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, this process becomes not only easier but also a lot more flexible and powerful. No more struggling with Excel's built-in formatting options—now you have a direct line of control through code!

Whether you're preparing data reports or creating financial statements, harnessing the power of Aspose.Cells will elevate your spreadsheet game to a whole new level. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into your projects with confidence, and let your data shine!
