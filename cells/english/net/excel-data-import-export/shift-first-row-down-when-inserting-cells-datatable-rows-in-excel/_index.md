# Shift First Row Down When Inserting DataTable Rows in Excel

## Introduction

Are you tired of manually shifting rows when inserting new data into your Excel spreadsheets? Well, you're in luck! In this article, we'll dive into how to automate this process using Aspose.Cells for .NET. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll not only learn how to work with data tables in Excel but also how to customize the import options to better suit your needs. Trust me; this can save you a lot of time and hassle! So, grab a cup of coffee, and let’s get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the coding, let's make sure you have everything set up:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed (2017 or later should work just fine).
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You need to have the Aspose.Cells library. If you haven’t done this yet, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Understanding of C# and Excel: A basic grasp of C# programming and how Excel works will certainly help you follow along more effectively.

You will also want to have a sample Excel file handy. In this guide, we’ll use a sample called `sampleImportTableOptionsShiftFirstRowDown.xlsx`. You can create this file or find a template that suits your needs.

## Import Packages

Before we dive into coding, we need to make sure we import the necessary packages. In your C# project, include the following namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
```

These packages are essential for working with the workbook, worksheet, and tables.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

### Create a New C# Project

Start by creating a new C# Console Application in Visual Studio. Give your project a suitable name, like “ExcelDataImport”.

### Add Aspose.Cells NuGet Package

To add the Aspose.Cells package, right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, select Manage NuGet Packages, and search for “Aspose.Cells”. Install the package to make sure you can access all the functionality we need.

## Step 2: Define the Data Table

Next, we’ll implement the `ICellsDataTable` interface to create a class that provides the data to be imported. Here’s how you can structure the `CellsDataTable` class:

```csharp
class CellsDataTable : ICellsDataTable
{
    int m_index = -1;
    static String[] colsNames = new String[] { "Pet", "Fruit", "Country", "Color" };
    static String[] col0data = new String[] { "Dog", "Cat", "Duck" };
    static String[] col1data = new String[] { "Apple", "Pear", "Banana" };
    static String[] col2data = new String[] { "UK", "USA", "China" };
    static String[] col3data = new String[] { "Red", "Green", "Blue" };
    static String[][] colsData = new String[][] { col0data, col1data, col2data, col3data };
    
    // ... Implement other members ...
}
```

Here, we’re defining the column names and the data for each column, which will facilitate the structure of our imported table.

## Step 3: Implement ICellsDataTable Interface Members

Within the `CellsDataTable` class, you need to implement the members of the `ICellsDataTable` interface. Here’s the required implementation:

```csharp
public object this[string columnName]
{
    get
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}

object ICellsDataTable.this[int columnIndex]
{
    get
    {
        return colsData[columnIndex][m_index];
    }
}

string[] ICellsDataTable.Columns
{
    get { return colsNames; }
}

int ICellsDataTable.Count
{
    get { return col0data.Length; }
}

void ICellsDataTable.BeforeFirst()
{
    m_index = -1;
}

bool ICellsDataTable.Next()
{
    m_index++;
    return (m_index < Count);
}
```

This part of the class handles data retrieval, defining how many rows and columns there are, and managing the current index state.

## Step 4: Write the Main Function

Now, let’s create the `Run` method to orchestrate the entire table import process:

```csharp
public static void Run()
{
    string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory\\";
    string outputDir = "Your Document Directory\\";
    
    CellsDataTable cellsDataTable = new CellsDataTable();
    Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleImportTableOptionsShiftFirstRowDown.xlsx");
    Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 5: Set Import Options

To control the import behavior, you should create an instance of `ImportTableOptions` and set the properties accordingly. Specifically, we want to set `ShiftFirstRowDown` to `false`.

```csharp
    ImportTableOptions opts = new ImportTableOptions();
    opts.ShiftFirstRowDown = false; // We don't want to shift the first row down
```

## Step 6: Import the DataTable

Now we can import the data from our `CellsDataTable` into the worksheet.

```csharp
    ws.Cells.ImportData(cellsDataTable, 2, 2, opts);
}
```

This command will directly insert your data table starting at the specified row and column.

## Step 7: Save the Workbook

Finally, we’ll save the modified workbook back to a file:

```csharp
    wb.Save(outputDir + "outputImportTableOptionsShiftFirstRowDown-False.xlsx");
}
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve learned how to insert DataTable rows into an Excel sheet without moving the first row using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This process not only streamlines data manipulation within Excel but also enhances your application's performance by automating a typically cumbersome task. With this knowledge in your toolkit, you're better equipped to handle Excel automation tasks, saving you time and effort.
