# Excel Data Alignment and Formatting

## Introduction

First off, let's talk about why you might want to change the alignment in the first place. Alignment is all about making sure your data is presented neatly, which can improve readability and give your spreadsheets a polished, professional look. With Aspose.Cells, you can adjust both horizontal and vertical alignment—whether you want your text to be left, right, centered, or stretched across cells. And the best part? You can do all this without losing that perfect formatting you've spent ages on!

## Changing Excel Cells Alignment Without Losing Formatting

Now, let’s get into the step-by-step process. Aspose.Cells for .NET allows you to interact with individual cells or ranges in an Excel worksheet, so you can easily customize their appearance, including alignment settings, without disturbing the rest of the formatting.

1. Select the Cells or Range:
   Begin by specifying the cells or range you want to adjust. This could be a single cell or a whole table depending on your needs.

2. Apply the Desired Alignment:
   Use the `.Style` property to apply horizontal or vertical alignment settings. Aspose.Cells gives you options like `TextAlignmentType.Center`, `TextAlignmentType.Left`, or `TextAlignmentType.Right` for horizontal alignment and similar options for vertical alignment.

3. Preserve the Formatting:
   The great thing about Aspose.Cells is that when you modify alignment using the `.Style` object, other formatting elements like borders, fonts, and colors remain intact. No need to worry about losing that custom style!
