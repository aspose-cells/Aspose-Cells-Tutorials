## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

### Basic Initialization
Start by including necessary namespaces and initializing your project with Aspose.Cells:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.ExternalConnections;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Set license here if available
        License license = new License();
        license.SetLicense("Aspose.Total.lic");
        
        Console.WriteLine("Setup complete!");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load and Check Workbook Connections

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates loading an Excel workbook and iterating through its external data connections to extract pertinent information.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Define the Source Directory**
Start by specifying the directory where your workbook resides:

```csharp
string sourceDir = @"YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
```

**Load the Workbook**
Use Aspose.Cells to load an Excel file with external connections:

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleFindQueryTablesAndListObjectsOfExternalDataConnections.xlsm");
```

**Iterate Through External Connections**
Loop through each connection and print its details:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < workbook.DataConnections.Count; i++)
{
    ExternalConnection externalConnection = workbook.DataConnections[i];
    
    Console.WriteLine("connection: " + externalConnection.Name);
    
    // Utilize the PrintTables method to display related data.
    PrintTables(workbook, externalConnection);
}
```

### Print Query Tables and List Objects

#### Overview
This functionality prints details about query tables and list objects linked to each connection.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Iterate Through Worksheets**
Check all worksheets for relevant query tables and list objects:

```csharp
for (int j = 0; j < workbook.Worksheets.Count; j++)
{
    Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[j];
```

**Process Query Tables**
Identify and print details of each query table associated with the external connection:

```csharp
    for (int k = 0; k < worksheet.QueryTables.Count; k++)
    {
        QueryTable qt = worksheet.QueryTables[k];

        if (ec.Id == qt.ConnectionId && qt.ConnectionId >= 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("querytable " + qt.Name);
            
            string n = qt.Name.Replace('+', '_').Replace('=', '_');
            Name name = workbook.Worksheets.Names["'" + worksheet.Name + "'!" + n];

            if (name != null)
            {
                Range range = name.GetRange();
                Console.WriteLine("refersto: " + range.RefersTo);
            }
        }
    }
```

**Process List Objects**
Extract and display information from list objects:

```csharp
    for (int k = 0; k < worksheet.ListObjects.Count; k++)
    {
        ListObject table = worksheet.ListObjects[k];
        
        if (table.DataSourceType == TableDataSourceType.QueryTable)
        {
            QueryTable qt = table.QueryTable;

            if (ec.Id == qt.ConnectionId && qt.ConnectionId >= 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("querytable " + qt.Name);
                Console.WriteLine("Table " + table.DisplayName);
                
                Console.WriteLine("refersto: " +
                    worksheet.Name + "!" + 
                    CellsHelper.CellIndexToName(table.StartRow, table.StartColumn) + ":" + 
                    CellsHelper.CellIndexToName(table.EndRow, table.EndColumn));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the path to your Excel file is correct.
