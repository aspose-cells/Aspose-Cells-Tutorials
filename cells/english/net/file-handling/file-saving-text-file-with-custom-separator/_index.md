# Saving Text File with Custom Separator

## Introduction
When it comes to handling spreadsheets, few tools are as powerful and versatile as Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you’re a developer in a corporate environment or simply someone looking to manipulate Excel files programmatically, Aspose.Cells is an invaluable resource. In this tutorial, we're going to explore how to save a text file using a custom separator with Aspose.Cells. So grab a cup of coffee, and let’s dive into the world of data manipulation!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the code, there are a few things you need to check off your list. Making sure you have everything in place will help keep the process smooth.
### Visual Studio Installed
You’ll need a working installation of Visual Studio to develop your .NET applications. Make sure it’s updated to the latest version for the best compatibility.
### Aspose.Cells for .NET
You’ll need to download the Aspose.Cells library. You can grab it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). It’s essential to use the latest version to leverage all new features and fixes.
### Knowledge of C# Basics
A basic understanding of C# and .NET framework will be beneficial. Don’t worry if you're not an expert; we’ll guide you through each line of code.
### Your Document Directory
You may need a specific directory to store your Excel files. Set this up to avoid any path-related issues down the road.
Now that we’ve got our prerequisites sorted, let’s move on to the practical side of things!
## Import Packages
To begin, you'll want to import the necessary packages from the Aspose.Cells library. This is where you tell your application what tools it will be using. Here’s how to do it:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
These statements should be at the very top of your C# file. Importing these libraries offers you access to the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Cells.

Let’s break down the process into manageable steps:
## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory
The first thing we need to do is define where our document will be stored. 
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string filePath = dataDir + "Book1.xlsx";
```
In this code, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path on your system where you want to keep your files. This could be something like `@"C:\Documents\"` on Windows. By doing this, you can easily manage where files are created and accessed during your operations.
## Step 2: Create a Workbook Object
Next, we’ll create a `Workbook` object, which acts as a representative of our Excel file. 
```csharp
// Create a Workbook object and opening the file from its path
Workbook wb = new Workbook(filePath);
```
Here, we’re instantiating a new `Workbook` using the file path we set up earlier. This object will now allow us to interact with the Excel file contents. If the file `Book1.xlsx` doesn’t exist in your specified directory, you will encounter an error.
## Step 3: Instantiate Text File’s Save Options
Now, let’s set up the save options. This is where we specify how we want to save our files – specifically, the separator we would like to use.
```csharp
// Instantiate Text File's Save Options
TxtSaveOptions options = new TxtSaveOptions();
```
The `TxtSaveOptions` class comes into play here, which allows customization for saving text files. Think of it as a toolbox with various tools (options) tailored for your needs.
## Step 4: Specify the Separator
With the save options object created, we can customize it by specifying a separator:
```csharp
// Specify the separator
options.Separator = Convert.ToChar(";");
```
In this example, we are using a semicolon (`;`) as our custom separator. You can substitute this with any character that makes sense for your data format. This is a key step because it defines how your data will be split when saved in the text file.
## Step 5: Save the File
Finally, let’s save our Excel file with our specified options!
```csharp
// Save the file with the options
wb.Save(dataDir + "output.csv", options);
```
This line saves the workbook we edited under the name `output.csv`, using your defined separator. Your Excel content is now neatly transformed into a text file with customized formatting!
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You’ve just navigated through the process of saving a text file with a custom separator using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This tutorial covered everything from setting up your directory to specifying save options and, ultimately, saving your file. You should now have a strong grasp of the steps involved, allowing you to implement this in your projects with ease.
