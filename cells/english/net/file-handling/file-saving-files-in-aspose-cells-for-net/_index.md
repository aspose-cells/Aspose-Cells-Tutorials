## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let's outline what you need to get started. Having these prerequisites in place will ensure a smooth experience.

### .NET Development Environment
Make sure you have a suitable .NET development environment set up. This can be Visual Studio or any other IDE of your choice compatible with .NET.

### Aspose.Cells Library
You will need to install the Aspose.Cells library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) or install it via NuGet by using the following command in your Package Manager Console:
```
Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

### Basic Knowledge of C#
Having a foundational understanding of C# programming will help you grasp the concepts quickly. Familiarity with object-oriented programming will also beneficial.

### File System Access
Ensure that your application has access to the file system where you intend to read or write Excel files. 

## Importing Packages

Before you can start working with Aspose.Cells, you need to import the necessary packages in your C# environment. Here's how you can do it:

### Start Your Project
1. Open your .NET project.
2. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
3. Select "Add" > "New Item" > choose a C# class.

### Add Using Directive
At the top of your C# file, you need to add the following using directive:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
This tells your application that you’ll be using functionalities from the Aspose.Cells library.

Now that you've set up your environment and imported the necessary packages, let's get to the juicy part—saving your Excel workbooks in various formats. We’ll break down the process into easy-to-follow steps for clarity.

## Step 1: Specify the Document Directory

First, you'll want to define where you’ll save your Excel files. In your code, set the `dataDir` variable to the target directory:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; 
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where you want the files saved.

## Step 2: Create a Workbook Object

Next, you need to create a workbook object, which serves as your working document:
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(); 
```
Here, you’ve initiated a new workbook. You can now manipulate this workbook as per your requirements — adding data, formatting cells, etc.

## Step 3: Saving in Different Formats

Let’s save the workbook in several formats to illustrate the versatility of Aspose.Cells.

### Save in Excel 97-2003 Format

To save your workbook in the older Excel 97-2003 format, you can use:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls"); 
```

### Save in Excel 2007 XLSX Format
For the widely-used XLSX format, the command will look like this:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xlsx"); 
```

### Save in Excel Binary XLSB Format
If you need a more compact file format, XLSB is handy. Here's how:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xlsb"); 
```

### Save in ODS Format
For users adopting open document standards, here's how:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.ods"); 
```

### Save as PDF
If you wish to save your workbook as a PDF for easy sharing or printing, you can do this:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.pdf"); 
```

### Save in HTML Format
To save your workbook as HTML, which is useful for web integration:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.html"); 
```

### Save in SpreadsheetML Format
Lastly, if you need to save your workbook in XML format compatible with Excel:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xml"); 
```

## Step 4: Run Your Application 

With all your code set, it's time to run your application. Ensure that no errors arise, and check the specified directory for your saved files in the chosen formats.
