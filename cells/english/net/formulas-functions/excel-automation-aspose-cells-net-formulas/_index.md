**What You'll Learn:**
- How to create an empty workbook using Aspose.Cells
- Populate cells with integer values efficiently
- Set and manage cell formulas using Aspose.Cells for .NET
- Add selected cells to Excel's formula watch window for real-time monitoring

Before diving in, let's ensure you have the necessary tools ready.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial effectively, make sure you have:

- **Aspose.Cells for .NET** library installed. We'll cover installation in the next section.
- A development environment set up with C# (e.g., Visual Studio).
- Basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables and functions.
- An active internet connection to download necessary packages.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

Aspose.Cells for .NET can be seamlessly integrated into your project, allowing you to manipulate Excel files without needing Microsoft Office installed on your machine. Let's get started with the installation process:

### Installation Information

**Using .NET CLI:**

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down the steps to create a workbook and manage formulas using Aspose.Cells for .NET. We will cover two main features: creating and populating a workbook, and setting/add formulas.

### Create and Populate a Workbook

#### Overview
Creating an empty Excel workbook and filling it with data is straightforward with Aspose.Cells. This feature helps automate the initial setup of your spreadsheets.

#### Steps to Implement

**1. Initialize Your Workbook**

Start by creating a new instance of `Workbook`. This object represents your entire Excel file.

```csharp
string outputDir = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

**2. Access and Populate Cells**

Access the first worksheet and populate cells with integer values:

```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
ws.Cells["A1"].PutValue(10); // Assign value 10 to cell A1
ws.Cells["A2"].PutValue(30); // Assign value 30 to cell A2
```

**3. Save the Workbook**

Finally, save your changes:

```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "CreateAndPopulateWorkbook.xlsx", SaveFormat.Xlsx);
```

### Set and Add Formulas to Cells in Watch Window

#### Overview
Formulas automate calculations within Excel files. Aspose.Cells allows you to set formulas programmatically, adding them to the watch window for real-time updates.

#### Steps to Implement

**1. Initialize Your Workbook**

As with the previous feature, begin by creating a new workbook instance.

```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

**2. Set Formulas**

Assign formulas to specific cells:

```csharp
Cell c1 = ws.Cells["C1"];
c1.Formula = "=Sum(A1,A2)"; // Calculate the sum of A1 and A2

Cell e1 = ws.Cells["E1"];
e1.Formula = "=A2*A1"; // Multiply values in A2 and A1
```

**3. Add Cells to Formula Watch Window**

Use the `CellWatches` collection to monitor these cells:

```csharp
Worksheet tws = wb.Worksheets[0];
tws.CellWatches.Add(c1.Name); // By name
tws.CellWatches.Add(e1.Row, e1.Column); // By row and column indices
```

**4. Save Your Workbook**

Don't forget to save the changes:

```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "SetAndAddFormulasToWatchWindow.xlsx", SaveFormat.Xlsx);
```
