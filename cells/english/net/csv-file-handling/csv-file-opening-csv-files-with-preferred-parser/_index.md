# Opening CSV Files with Preferred Parser

## Introduction
When dealing with CSV files, sometimes you want to handle different data types with custom parsers. This tutorial will guide you on how to open CSV files with a preferred parser using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you want to handle text, dates, or other custom formats, this guide will walk you through each step with a clear explanation.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the code, let’s cover the essential items you need to get started.
1. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). You can also use the free trial [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).
2. .NET Development Environment: Visual Studio is recommended, but any .NET-compatible IDE will work.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with C# and object-oriented programming.
## Import Packages
To use Aspose.Cells, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces at the top of your C# file:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
Now that we’ve set the stage, let's walk through how to open a CSV file with a preferred parser, handling different data formats such as text and dates.
## Step 1: Define Custom Parsers
To handle different data types, such as text or specific date formats, you need to define custom parsers. In Aspose.Cells, custom parsers implement the `ICustomParser` interface.
### 1.1 Create a Text Parser
This parser handles regular text values. It doesn't modify the format, so the value is returned as-is.
```csharp
class TextParser : ICustomParser
{
    public object ParseObject(string value)
    {
        return value;
    }
    public string GetFormat()
    {
        return "";
    }
}
```
The `ParseObject` method simply returns the input value. It’s like saying, "Don’t change anything, just give me the text!"
### 1.2 Create a Date Parser
For dates, you'll want to ensure that the CSV data is correctly parsed into `DateTime` objects. Here’s how you can create a date parser:
```csharp
class DateParser : ICustomParser
{
    public object ParseObject(string value)
    {
        DateTime myDate = DateTime.ParseExact(value, "dd/MM/yyyy", 
            System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        return myDate;
    }
    public string GetFormat()
    {
        return "dd/MM/yyyy";
    }
}
```
In this parser, we use `ParseExact` to ensure the date is interpreted correctly based on a predefined format (`"dd/MM/yyyy"`). This way, any date in your CSV following this format will be processed without issues.
## Step 2: Configure Load Options
Next, you need to configure how the CSV file is loaded. This is done using the `TxtLoadOptions` class, which allows you to specify parsing options, including encoding and custom parsers.
### 2.1 Set Up Load Options
We’ll start by initializing the `TxtLoadOptions` and defining key parameters such as the separator and encoding:
```csharp
TxtLoadOptions oTxtLoadOptions = new TxtLoadOptions(LoadFormat.Csv);
oTxtLoadOptions.Separator = Convert.ToChar(",");
oTxtLoadOptions.Encoding = Encoding.UTF8;
oTxtLoadOptions.ConvertDateTimeData = true;
```
- Separator: This defines the character used to separate values in the CSV file (commas, in this case).
- Encoding: We use UTF-8 encoding to handle a wide range of characters.
- ConvertDateTimeData: Setting this to true ensures that date values will be automatically converted to `DateTime` objects when possible.
### 2.2 Apply Custom Parsers
Next, we'll assign the parsers we created earlier to handle the values in the CSV:
```csharp
oTxtLoadOptions.PreferredParsers = new ICustomParser[] 
{ 
    new TextParser(), 
    new DateParser() 
};
```
This tells Aspose.Cells to use the `TextParser` for general text values and the `DateParser` for any date fields it encounters in the CSV file.
## Step 3: Load and Read the CSV File
Now that the load options are configured, you can load the CSV file into an `Aspose.Cells.Workbook` object.
### 3.1 Load the CSV File
We load the CSV file by passing the file path and the configured `TxtLoadOptions` to the `Workbook` constructor:
```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
Workbook oExcelWorkBook = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook(sourceDir + "samplePreferredParser.csv", oTxtLoadOptions);
```
This step converts your CSV data into a fully functional Excel workbook, with each value parsed according to your preferred rules.
## Step 4: Access and Display Cell Data
Once the CSV is loaded into the workbook, you can start working with the data. For example, you might want to print the type and value of specific cells.
### 4.1 Retrieve and Display Cell A1
Let’s retrieve the first cell (A1) and display its value and type:
```csharp
Cell oCell = oExcelWorkBook.Worksheets[0].Cells["A1"];
Console.WriteLine("A1: " + oCell.Type.ToString() + " - " + oCell.DisplayStringValue);
```
Here, the `Type` property shows the data type (such as `String` or `DateTime`), and `DisplayStringValue` gives you the formatted value.
### 4.2 Retrieve and Display Cell B1
Similarly, we can retrieve and display another cell, such as B1:
```csharp
oCell = oExcelWorkBook.Worksheets[0].Cells["B1"];
Console.WriteLine("B1: " + oCell.Type.ToString() + " - " + oCell.DisplayStringValue);
```
This process can be repeated for as many cells as you need to inspect.
## Step 5: Save the Workbook
After working with the data, you may want to save the workbook to a new file. Aspose.Cells makes this easy with a simple `Save` method:
```csharp
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
oExcelWorkBook.Save(outputDir + "outputsamplePreferredParser.xlsx");
```
This saves the workbook as an Excel file, preserving all the formatting and data parsing you've applied.
## Conclusion
Opening CSV files with a preferred parser in Aspose.Cells for .NET is a flexible and powerful way to handle different data types. By creating custom parsers and configuring load options, you can ensure that your CSV files are parsed exactly how you need them to be, whether you're dealing with text, dates, or other custom formats. With this tutorial, you’re now equipped to handle more complex data parsing scenarios in your projects.
## FAQ's
