# Add TextBox Control to Chart

## Introduction

Creating dynamic and visually appealing charts in Excel is a fantastic way to represent data effectively. One nifty feature you can use is adding a TextBox to a chart. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, this task becomes easy and fun! In this guide, we will walk you through the process of integrating a TextBox into your chart step by step. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting, this tutorial will give you all the tools you need to enhance your Excel charts. So, are you ready to dive in?

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into coding, there are a few things you should have in place:

- Basic Understanding of C#: A fundamental grasp of C# programming will be helpful. Don’t worry; you don’t need to be an expert, just comfortable navigating the syntax.
- Installed Aspose.Cells Library: Ensure you have the Aspose.Cells for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) if you haven't already.
- Visual Studio: Familiarity with Visual Studio or any IDE that you prefer to use for the .NET framework is essential.
- An Existing Excel File: For this example, we will work with an existing Excel file named "sampleAddingTextBoxControlInChart.xls". You can create one or download a sample.

Now that we have everything in place, let’s get to the coding part!

## Import Packages

First things first, we need to import the necessary Aspose.Cells namespaces to our C# project. You can do this easily by including the following lines at the top of your code file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Define Your Source and Output Directories

Before we start working with the Excel file, it’s important to define where your input file is located and where you want to save the output file. This helps in keeping your project organized.

```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` and `"Your Output Directory"` with the actual paths on your system.

## Step 2: Open the Existing Excel File

Next, we need to open the Excel file that contains the chart we want to modify. This will allow us to fetch the chart and make changes.

```csharp
// Open the existing file.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleAddingTextBoxControlInChart.xls");
```
This line initializes a new Workbook object with our specified file.

## Step 3: Access the Chart in the Worksheet

Since charts in Excel are stored within a worksheet, we need to first access the worksheet and then get the desired chart. For this example, we’ll access the first chart in the first worksheet.

```csharp
// Get the designer chart in the first sheet.
Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
Aspose.Cells.Charts.Chart chart = sheet.Charts[0];
```
By changing the index value, you can select different worksheets or charts if your file has more.

## Step 4: Add a New TextBox to the Chart

Now, we are ready to add our TextBox. We’ll specify its position and size when creating it.

```csharp
// Add a new textbox to the chart.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.TextBox textbox0 = chart.Shapes.AddTextBoxInChart(400, 1100, 350, 2550);
```
In this command, the parameters define the location (x, y) and size (width, height) of the TextBox in the chart. Adjust these values based on your specific layout needs.

## Step 5: Set the Text for the TextBox

Once the TextBox is in place, it’s time to fill it with content. You could add any text that you deem necessary for your chart.

```csharp
// Fill the text.
textbox0.Text = "Sales By Region";
```
Feel free to replace "Sales By Region" with any text relevant to your data.

## Step 6: Adjust TextBox Properties

Now, let’s make our TextBox look good! You can customize various properties like font color, size, and style.

```csharp
// Set the font color.
textbox0.Font.Color = Color.Maroon; // Change to your desired color

// Set the font to bold.
textbox0.Font.IsBold = true;

// Set the font size.
textbox0.Font.Size = 14;

// Set font attribute to italic.
textbox0.Font.IsItalic = true;
```

Each of these lines modifies the appearance of the text inside your TextBox, enhancing visibility and appeal.

## Step 7: Format the TextBox Appearance

It’s also essential to format the TextBox’s background and border. This makes it stand out on the chart.

```csharp
// Get the fill format of the textbox.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.FillFormat fillformat = textbox0.Fill;

// Get the line format type of the textbox.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.LineFormat lineformat = textbox0.Line;

// Set the line weight.
lineformat.Weight = 2;

// Set the dash style to solid.
lineformat.DashStyle = Aspose.Cells.Drawing.MsoLineDashStyle.Solid;
```

These options allow you to set the background fill of the TextBox and customize its border.

## Step 8: Save the Modified Excel File

The last step is to save the changes you've made to a new Excel file. This will ensure that your original file remains untouched.

```csharp
// Save the excel file.
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputAddingTextBoxControlInChart.xls");
```
Replace `"outputAddingTextBoxControlInChart.xls"` with whichever filename you prefer.
