# Add Arrow Head to Shape in Excel

## Introduction
Creating visually engaging Excel spreadsheets is crucial, especially when presenting data in a clear and informative manner. One way to enhance such presentations is by adding shapes, like lines with arrowheads. This guide will walk you through how to add arrowheads to shapes in an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you're a developer looking to automate reports or simply someone interested in enhancing your Excel spreadsheets, this article will provide the insights you need.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, let’s make sure you have everything ready to go. Here’s what you need:
1. Basic Knowledge of C# and .NET: Understanding the basics of programming in C# will help you navigate through the code examples more smoothly.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library installed. You can get it from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Development Environment: An IDE like Visual Studio to run and test your .NET applications.
4. A Free Trial or a License: If you haven’t already, consider downloading a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) or acquiring a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) for Aspose.Cells.
5. Familiarity with Excel: Knowing how to navigate Excel will help you understand how the shapes and lines interact with your data.
## Import Packages
To use Aspose.Cells, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces into your C# project. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your code file:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System.Drawing;
```
These namespaces provide access to the essential classes and methods needed to manipulate Excel files and create shapes. 

Now, let's break down the process into simple, manageable steps. 
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project Environment
First, open your IDE (like Visual Studio) and create a new C# project. You can choose a Console Application since this will allow us to run the code directly from the terminal.

Next, ensure that Aspose.Cells is referenced in your project. If you're using NuGet, you can easily add it through the Package Manager Console with the following command:
```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```
## Step 2: Define the Document Directory
Now it’s time to define where your documents will be stored. You'll want to create a directory to hold your workbook. Here’s how you can do this in code:
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
	System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
Make sure to change `"Your Document Directory"` to an appropriate path on your system where you have write permissions.
## Step 3: Create the Workbook and Worksheet
### Instantiating a New Workbook
Next, you’ll need to create a workbook and add a worksheet to it. This is as simple as:
```csharp
// Instantiate a new Workbook.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
### Accessing the First Worksheet
Now, let’s grab the first worksheet, where we’ll add our shapes.
```csharp
// Get the first worksheet in the book.
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
## Step 4: Add a Line Shape
Now, let’s add a line to our worksheet:
```csharp
// Add a line to the worksheet
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.LineShape line2 = worksheet.Shapes.AddLine(7, 0, 1, 0, 85, 250);
```
In this example, we’re creating a line shape starting at coordinates (7, 0) and ending at (85, 250). You can adjust these numbers to customize the size and position of your line as needed.
## Step 5: Customize the Line
You can make the line more visually appealing by changing its color and weight. Here’s how:
```csharp
// Set the line color
line2.Line.FillType = FillType.Solid;
line2.Line.SolidFill.Color = Color.Blue;
// Set the weight of the line.
line2.Line.Weight = 3;
```
In this case, we set the line to a solid fill of blue and a weight of 3. Experiment with different colors and weights to find what works for you!
## Step 6: Modify Line Placement
Next, you need to set how the line is placed in the worksheet. For this example, we’ll make it free-floating:
```csharp
// Set the placement.
line2.Placement = PlacementType.FreeFloating;
```
## Step 7: Add Arrowheads
Here is the exciting part! Let’s add arrowheads to both ends of our line:
```csharp
// Set the line arrows.
line2.Line.EndArrowheadWidth = MsoArrowheadWidth.Medium;
line2.Line.EndArrowheadStyle = MsoArrowheadStyle.Arrow;
line2.Line.EndArrowheadLength = MsoArrowheadLength.Medium;
line2.Line.BeginArrowheadStyle = MsoArrowheadStyle.ArrowDiamond;
line2.Line.BeginArrowheadLength = MsoArrowheadLength.Medium;
```
This code sets the end of the line to have a medium-width arrow, while the beginning will have an arrow in a diamond style. You can adjust these properties based on your design preferences.
## Step 8: Make Gridlines Invisible
Sometimes, gridlines can hinder the visual appeal of a chart or shape. To turn them off, use the following line:
```csharp
// Make the gridlines invisible in the first worksheet.
workbook.Worksheets[0].IsGridlinesVisible = false;
```
## Step 9: Save the Excel File
Finally, it’s time to save your work:
```csharp
// Save the excel file.
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xlsx");
```
Make sure the filename ends with the appropriate Excel file extension, like `.xlsx` in this case. 

## Conclusion
Adding arrowheads to shapes in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your spreadsheets. With just a few lines of code, you can create professional-looking diagrams that communicate information clearly. Whether you're automating reports or simply creating visual aids, mastering these techniques will undoubtedly make your presentations stand out.
