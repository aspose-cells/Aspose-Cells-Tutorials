# Add Group Box to Worksheet in Excel

## Introduction
When it comes to data presentation, Excel is king. Adding interactive elements like group boxes can make your spreadsheets more engaging and user-friendly. Today, we're diving into the world of Aspose.Cells for .NET, a powerful library that helps you manipulate Excel sheets effortlessly. But don't worry if you're not a coding wizard—this guide breaks everything down into simple steps. Are you ready to enhance your Excel skills? Let’s get started!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the code, there are a few things you'll need:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine; it’s where you’ll be writing the .NET code.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You need to download this library. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). 
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: While I'll explain everything step by step, a little understanding of C# will help you follow along.
## Import Packages
For any project, you'll first need to import the necessary packages. Here, Aspose.Cells will be your main focus. Here’s how to do it:
## Step 1: Open Your Project in Visual Studio
Launch Visual Studio and open up your existing project or create a new one. 
## Step 2: Add Reference to Aspose.Cells
- Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
- Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
- Search for "Aspose.Cells" and install it. This will allow you to use all the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.Cells library.
## Step 3: Include Using Directive
At the top of your C# file, include the Aspose.Cells namespace:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System.Drawing;
```
This gives you access to the classes necessary for working with Excel files.
Now that we're set up, let’s dive into the heart of the tutorial—adding a group box with radio buttons to an Excel worksheet. We'll break this process down into multiple steps for clarity.
## Step 1: Setup Your Document Directory
Before creating any Excel file, you'll need to determine where you'd like to save it. Let’s create a directory if it doesn’t already exist.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Specify your desired path
// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
This code checks if the directory where the Excel file will be saved exists. If not, it creates one—it’s like preparing your workspace before diving into the project!
## Step 2: Instantiate a New Workbook
Next, you need to create an Excel workbook where you’ll add your group box.
```csharp
// Instantiate a new Workbook.
Workbook excelbook = new Workbook();
```
This line initializes a new instance of a Workbook. Think of this as opening a fresh, blank Excel file ready for modifications.
## Step 3: Add a Group Box
Now, let’s add that group box. 
```csharp
// Add a group box to the first worksheet.
GroupBox box = excelbook.Worksheets[0].Shapes.AddGroupBox(1, 0, 1, 0, 300, 250);
```
Here, you are adding a group box at specified coordinates in the first worksheet. The parameters define the position and size of the box, just like positioning furniture in a room!
## Step 4: Set the Caption of the Group Box
Now, let's give your group box a title!
```csharp
// Set the caption of the group box.
box.Text = "Age Groups";
box.Placement = PlacementType.FreeFloating;
```
The “Age Groups” string sets the label that appears on the group box. Setting the `Placement` as `FreeFloating` allows the box to be movable—flexibility is key!
## Step 5: Make the Group Box 2-D
While 3D might sound fancy, we’re going for a classic look here.
```csharp
// Make it 2-D box.
box.Shadow = false;
```
This code removes the shadow effect, giving the box a flat appearance—like a simple sheet of paper!
## Step 6: Add Radio Buttons
Let’s spice things up by adding some radio buttons for user input.
## Step 6.1: Add the First Radio Button
```csharp
// Add a radio button.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.RadioButton radio1 = excelbook.Worksheets[0].Shapes.AddRadioButton(3, 0, 2, 0, 30, 110);
// Set its text string.
radio1.Text = "20-29";
// Set A1 cell as a linked cell for the radio button.
radio1.LinkedCell = "A1";
```
You create a radio button for the age group 20-29, linking it to cell A1 in the worksheet. This means when this button is selected, cell A1 reflects that choice!
## Step 6.2: Customize the First Radio Button
Now let’s give it some style.
```csharp
// Make the radio button 3-D.
radio1.Shadow = true;
// Set the weight of the radio button.
radio1.Line.Weight = 4;
// Set the dash style of the radio button.
radio1.Line.DashStyle = MsoLineDashStyle.Solid;
```
By adding a shadow and adjusting the line style, we’re enhancing the button’s visibility. It’s like adding decorations to make it pop off the page!
## Step 6.3: Repeat for More Radio Buttons
Repeat this process for additional age groups:
```csharp
// Second Radio Button
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.RadioButton radio2 = excelbook.Worksheets[0].Shapes.AddRadioButton(6, 0, 2, 0, 30, 110);
radio2.Text = "30-39";
radio2.LinkedCell = "A1";
radio2.Shadow = true;
radio2.Line.Weight = 4;
radio2.Line.DashStyle = MsoLineDashStyle.Solid;
// Third Radio Button
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.RadioButton radio3 = excelbook.Worksheets[0].Shapes.AddRadioButton(9, 0, 2, 0, 30, 110);
radio3.Text = "40-49";
radio3.LinkedCell = "A1";
radio3.Shadow = true;
radio3.Line.Weight = 4;
radio3.Line.DashStyle = MsoLineDashStyle.Solid;
```
Each radio button serves as a choice for different age ranges, linked back to the same cell A1. This allows for a simple, user-friendly selection process.
## Step 7: Group the Shapes
With everything in place, let's tidy things up by grouping our shapes. 
```csharp
// Get the shapes.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Shape[] shapeobjects = new Shape[] { box, radio1, radio2, radio3 };
// Group the shapes.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.GroupShape group = excelbook.Worksheets[0].Shapes.Group(shapeobjects);
```
This step combines everything into one cohesive unit. It’s like putting a frame around your collection of art—it binds them together beautifully!
## Step 8: Save the Excel File
Finally, let’s save our masterpiece!
```csharp
// Save the excel file.
excelbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls");
```
This line of code writes your changes to a new Excel file named "book1.out.xls" in your specified directory. Like sealing an envelope, your work is now safely stored!
## Conclusion
