# Add Line Control to Worksheet in Excel

## Introduction
Excel spreadsheets are not just about rows and columns of data; they’re also a canvas for visualization. Adding line controls can enhance the way information is represented in your worksheets, making relationships and trends much clearer. Enter Aspose.Cells for .NET, a powerful library that simplifies the process of creating and manipulating Excel files programmatically. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to add line controls to a worksheet using Aspose.Cells. If you’re ready to elevate your Excel game, let’s dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before you start adding lines to your Excel worksheets, here are a few things you’ll need:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. If you don't, you can download it from the [website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: This library must be referenced in your project. You can find detailed documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/) and download the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code we'll be looking at.
4. A Windows Environment: Since Aspose.Cells is designed for .NET applications, a Windows environment is preferred.
## Import Packages
Let’s get our coding environment set up before we start adding some lines to your Excel worksheet. Here’s how to import the required Aspose.Cells package into your project.
### Create a New Project
- Open Visual Studio.
- Create a new Console Application project. You can name it whatever you like—perhaps "ExcelLineDemo" for clarity.
### Install Aspose.Cells
- Go to NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio (`Tools` -> `NuGet Package Manager` -> `Manage NuGet Packages for Solution`).
- Search for `Aspose.Cells` and install it. This action will add the necessary libraries to your project.
### Import the Namespace
At the top of your Main program file, add the following using directive to make Aspose.Cells accessible:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
```
By doing this, you can now use all functions from the Aspose.Cells library without prefixing them.
Now that we're set up, it's time to add some lines to our worksheet. We'll go through each step in detail.
## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory
Before you start working with your Excel file, you need to define where it'll be saved. Here’s how you do it:
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with a valid path on your system where you want to store the output file.
## Step 2: Create the Directory
It's a good practice to ensure the directory exists. If it doesn't, you can create it with the following code:
```csharp
// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
This code snippet checks whether the specified directory exists and creates it if it doesn’t. It's like checking your backpack before heading out on a hike—you want to make sure you have everything you need!
## Step 3: Instantiate a New Workbook
Now, let’s create a new Excel workbook. This is the canvas on which you will draw your lines.
```csharp
// Instantiate a new Workbook.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
Creating a new instance of `Workbook` gives you a fresh, blank Excel file to work with.
## Step 4: Access the First Worksheet
Every workbook has at least one worksheet, and we’ll be using the first one for our lines.
```csharp
// Get the first worksheet in the book.
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
Here, we’re selecting the first worksheet by accessing it through the `Worksheets` collection of the `Workbook`.
## Step 5: Add the First Line
Let’s start adding some lines. The first line will be solid in style.
```csharp
// Add a new line to the worksheet.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.LineShape line1 = worksheet.Shapes.AddLine(5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 250);
```
In this statement:
- `AddLine` method adds a line starting at the coordinates `(5, 0)` and ending at `(1, 0)` extending to a height of `250`.
- The coordinates `(5, 0)` represent the starting position on the worksheet, while `(1, 0, 0, 250)` denotes the ending distance.
## Step 6: Set Line Properties
Now, let’s personalize the line a bit—set its dash style and placement.
```csharp
// Set the line dash style
line1.Line.DashStyle = MsoLineDashStyle.Solid;
// Set the placement.
line1.Placement = PlacementType.FreeFloating;
```
Here, we’re telling the line to remain in one place regardless of changes in the worksheet structure by using `PlacementType.FreeFloating`.
## Step 7: Add Additional Lines
Let’s add a second line with a different style, using a dashed style.
```csharp
// Add another line to the worksheet.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.LineShape line2 = worksheet.Shapes.AddLine(7, 0, 1, 0, 85, 250);
// Set the line dash style.
line2.Line.DashStyle = MsoLineDashStyle.DashLongDash;
// Set the weight of the line.
line2.Line.Weight = 4;
// Set the placement.
line2.Placement = PlacementType.FreeFloating;
```
Notice how we adjusted the placement and changed the dash style to `DashLongDash`. The weight property allows you to control the thickness of the line.
## Step 8: Add the Third Line
One more line! Let’s add a solid line to complete our drawing.
```csharp
// Add the third line to the worksheet.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.LineShape line3 = worksheet.Shapes.AddLine(13, 0, 1, 0, 0, 250);
```
Again, we configure its properties similarly to how we set up the previous lines.
## Step 9: Hide Gridlines
To give our drawing a cleaner look, let’s hide the gridlines of the worksheet.
```csharp
// Make the gridlines invisible in the first worksheet.
workbook.Worksheets[0].IsGridlinesVisible = false;
```
Hiding the gridlines helps users focus more on the actual lines you added, similar to how a painter clears the area around their canvas to avoid distractions.
## Step 10: Save the Workbook
Finally, let’s save our workbook so that our hard work doesn’t go to waste!
```csharp
// Save the excel file.
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls");
```
You can name the output file whatever you like—just ensure it ends with `.xls` or another supported Excel file extension.
