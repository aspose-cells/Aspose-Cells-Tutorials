# Add Spinner Control to Worksheet in Excel

## Introduction
If you're diving into the world of Excel automation using .NET, you've probably come across the need for more interactive controls within your spreadsheets. One such control is the Spinner, which allows users to increment or decrement a value easily. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to add a Spinner control to an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. We’ll break it down into digestible steps so you can follow along seamlessly. 
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the code, let's ensure you have everything set up for a smooth experience:
1. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library. If you haven't installed it yet, you can grab the latest version from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
2. Visual Studio: You should have a working installation of Visual Studio or any other .NET IDE that you prefer.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets easily. If you're just starting out, don’t worry! I’ll walk you through each part.
## Import Packages
To use Aspose.Cells in your project, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Here’s how you can set up your environment:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System.Drawing;
```
These namespaces allow you to access the core functionalities of Aspose.Cells, including workbook manipulation and drawing capabilities for shapes like the Spinner.
Now that we've covered the prerequisites and imported the necessary packages, let’s dive into the step-by-step guide. Each step is designed to be clear and concise so you can implement it easily.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory
Before you start coding, it's a good practice to organize your files. Let's create a directory for our Excel files.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
Here, we specify a path for our document directory. If the directory doesn’t exist, we create it. This ensures that all our generated files have a designated home.
## Step 2: Create a New Workbook
Now it's time to create an Excel workbook where we’ll add our Spinner control.
```csharp
// Instantiate a new Workbook.
Workbook excelbook = new Workbook();
```
The `Workbook` class represents an Excel file. By instantiating it, we create a new workbook ready for modifications.
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
We’ll add our Spinner to the first worksheet in the workbook.
```csharp
// Get the first worksheet.
Worksheet worksheet = excelbook.Worksheets[0];
```
This line accesses the first worksheet (index 0) from our workbook. You can have multiple worksheets, but for this example, we’ll keep it simple.
## Step 4: Work with Cells
Next, let’s work with the cells in our worksheet. We will set some values and styles.
```csharp
// Get the worksheet cells.
Cells cells = worksheet.Cells;
// Input a string value into A1 cell.
cells["A1"].PutValue("Select Value:");
// Set the font color of the cell.
cells["A1"].GetStyle().Font.Color = Color.Red;
// Set the font text bold.
cells["A1"].GetStyle().Font.IsBold = true;
// Input value into A2 cell.
cells["A2"].PutValue(0);
```
Here, we're populating cell A1 with a prompt, applying a red color, and making the text bold. We also set cell A2 to an initial value of 0, which will be linked to our Spinner.
## Step 5: Style the A2 Cell
Next, let’s apply some styles to the A2 cell to make it more visually appealing.
```csharp
// Set the shading color to black with solid background.
cells["A2"].GetStyle().ForegroundColor = Color.Black;
cells["A2"].GetStyle().Pattern = BackgroundType.Solid;
// Set the font color of the cell.
cells["A2"].GetStyle().Font.Color = Color.White;
// Set the font text bold.
cells["A2"].GetStyle().Font.IsBold = true;
```
We're adding a black background with a solid pattern to cell A2 and setting the font color to white. This contrast will make it stand out on the worksheet.
## Step 6: Add the Spinner Control
Now, we’re ready to add the Spinner control to our worksheet.
```csharp
// Add a spinner control.
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Spinner spinner = excelbook.Worksheets[0].Shapes.AddSpinner(1, 0, 1, 0, 20, 18);
```
This line adds a Spinner control to the worksheet. The parameters specify the position and size of the Spinner (row, column, width, height).
## Step 7: Configure the Spinner Properties
Let’s customize the Spinner’s behavior to suit our needs.
```csharp
// Set the placement type of the spinner.
spinner.Placement = PlacementType.FreeFloating;
// Set the linked cell for the control.
spinner.LinkedCell = "A2";
// Set the maximum value.
spinner.Max = 10;
// Set the minimum value.
spinner.Min = 0;
// Set the increment change for the control.
spinner.IncrementalChange = 2;
// Set it 3-D shading.
spinner.Shadow = true;
```
Here, we set the Spinner’s properties. We link it to cell A2, allowing it to control the value displayed there. The minimum and maximum values define the range the Spinner can work within, while the incremental change sets how much the value changes with each click. Adding 3-D shading gives it a polished look.
## Step 8: Save the Excel File
Finally, let’s save our Excel workbook with the Spinner included.
```csharp
// Save the excel file.
excelbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls");
```
This command saves the workbook to the specified directory. You can change the filename as needed.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully added a Spinner control to an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This interactive element enhances user experience by allowing quick adjustments to values. Whether you're creating a dynamic reporting tool or a data entry form, the Spinner control can be a valuable addition.
