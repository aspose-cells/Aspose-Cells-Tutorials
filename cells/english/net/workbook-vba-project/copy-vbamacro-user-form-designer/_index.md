# Copy VBAMacro User Form Designer Storage to Workbook using Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
Welcome! If you're looking to enhance your Excel experience with VBA macros and user forms, you're in the right place! In this guide, we're diving into how you can seamlessly copy a VBA Macro UserForm Designer from one workbook to another using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, we will walk you through every crucial step. Consider this your playbook for mastering the art of handling Excel files programmatically. Ready to dive in? Let’s go!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of coding, let’s ensure you have everything you need:
1. C# Development Environment: You should have a working environment ready for C# development. Visual Studio is highly recommended.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library integrated into your project. You can easily [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of VBA and Excel Macros: A good understanding of VBA and how Excel macros work will help you navigate through this tutorial with ease.
4. An Excel File with a User Form: To experiment with, create or obtain an Excel workbook that contains a User Form, preferably with macros enabled (like `.xlsm` files).
## Import Packages
In your C# project, you’ll need to import certain namespaces at the top of your file to utilize Aspose.Cells functionalities. Here’s how you do it:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Cells.Vba;
```
Including these namespaces allows you to access all the powerful tools embedded within the Aspose.Cells library. 
Now that we have our prerequisites and packages covered, it's time to move onto the fun part: coding! Let's break it down step-by-step.
## Step 1: Define Your Source and Output Directories
First, you need to establish where your files are located:
```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Here, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your files are stored. This is where our source workbook (with the UserForm) will be grabbed from and where the new workbook will be saved.
## Step 2: Create an Empty Target Workbook
Next, let’s create our target workbook where we’ll be copying our user form and macros:
```csharp
// Create empty target workbook
Workbook target = new Workbook();
```
This line of code initializes a new, empty workbook for us to fill with data. Think of it as a blank canvas for your masterpiece!
## Step 3: Load Your Template Workbook
We need to load up the workbook that contains your user form and macros:
```csharp
// Load the Excel file containing VBA-Macro Designer User Form
Workbook templateFile = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleDesignerForm.xlsm");
```
Make sure to change `"sampleDesignerForm.xlsm"` to the name of your actual file. This workbook is like your recipe book—it's what we’ll draw our ingredients from!
## Step 4: Copy Worksheets to Target Workbook
Now, let's start copying worksheets from our template to the target workbook:
```csharp
// Copy all template worksheets to target workbook
foreach (Worksheet ws in templateFile.Worksheets)
{
    if (ws.Type == SheetType.Worksheet)
    {
        Worksheet s = target.Worksheets.Add(ws.Name);
        s.Copy(ws);
        // Put message in cell A2 of the target worksheet
        s.Cells["A2"].PutValue("VBA Macro and User Form copied from template to target.");
    }
}
```
In this step, we're looping through each worksheet in the template and copying them over to our target workbook. If you think about it, it’s like transferring your best recipes from one cookbook to another!
## Step 5: Copy VBA Macros from the Template
Next up, we’ll copy the VBA macros, including the UserForm Designer modules, to our new workbook:
```csharp
// Copy the VBA-Macro Designer UserForm from Template to Target
foreach (VbaModule vbaItem in templateFile.VbaProject.Modules)
{
    if (vbaItem.Name == "ThisWorkbook")
    {
        // Copy ThisWorkbook module code
        target.VbaProject.Modules["ThisWorkbook"].Codes = vbaItem.Codes;
    }
    else
    {
        // Copy other modules code and data
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print(vbaItem.Name);
        int vbaMod = 0;
        Worksheet sheet = target.Worksheets.GetSheetByCodeName(vbaItem.Name);
        if (sheet == null)
        {
            vbaMod = target.VbaProject.Modules.Add(vbaItem.Type, vbaItem.Name);
        }
        else
        {
            vbaMod = target.VbaProject.Modules.Add(sheet);
        }
        target.VbaProject.Modules[vbaMod].Codes = vbaItem.Codes;
        if ((vbaItem.Type == VbaModuleType.Designer))
        {
            // Get the data of the user form i.e. designer storage
            byte[] designerStorage = templateFile.VbaProject.Modules.GetDesignerStorage(vbaItem.Name);
            // Add the designer storage to target Vba Project
            target.VbaProject.Modules.AddDesignerStorage(vbaItem.Name, designerStorage);
        }
    }
}
```
This hefty chunk of code handles checking each VBA module in the template file. We're copying over the UserForm design and its associated codes. It’s like ensuring you not only get Grandma’s famous pie recipe but also her exact baking techniques!
## Step 6: Save the Target Workbook
After we achieve all our copies, it's time to save our hard work:
```csharp
// Save the target workbook
target.Save(outputDir + "outputDesignerForm.xlsm", SaveFormat.Xlsm);
```
Make sure to modify the output filename as needed. Once you save it, you're effectively creating your own tailored version of the workbook brimming with macros and user forms. How exciting is that?
## Step 7: Confirm Success
Finally, let’s print a success message to the console:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("CopyVBAMacroUserFormDesignerStorageToWorkbook executed successfully.\r\n");
```
This little line reassures you that your process went smoothly. It’s the cherry on top of your coding sundae!
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've completed the step-by-step guide to copying a VBA Macro User Form Designer from one workbook to another using Aspose.Cells for .NET. It might seem a bit overwhelming at first, but with practice, you'll handle workbook manipulations like a pro.
