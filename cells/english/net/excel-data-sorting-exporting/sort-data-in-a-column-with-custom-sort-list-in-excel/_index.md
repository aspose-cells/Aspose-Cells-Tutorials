# Sort Data in a Column with Custom Sort List in Excel

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up your project, loading an Excel file, and sorting data within a specified range using a custom sort order. By following this guide, you'll gain hands-on experience that can enhance your data management skills and usability of the Aspose.Cells library.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, let's outline some prerequisites to ensure a smooth learning experience.

### Basic Knowledge of C#

While the tutorial is designed to guide you through each step, having a foundational understanding of C# will make it easier to grasp the concepts presented.

### .NET Development Environment

Ensure you have a working .NET development environment set up. You can use Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET development.

### Aspose.Cells for .NET NuGet Package

You need the Aspose.Cells library for .NET installed in your project. You can easily add it via NuGet Package Manager. 

Here’s how to do it:

1. Open your project in Visual Studio.
2. Go to "Tools" > "NuGet Package Manager" > "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution".
3. Search for `Aspose.Cells` and install the latest version.

### Basic Excel File for Testing

You’ll need a sample Excel file to work with. You can create a simple Excel file with random country names and their codes.

## Import Packages

To get started, let’s import the necessary packages into your project. Here’s a snippet of how to set up your code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
```

With the packages imported, we’re ready to move forward.

## Step 1: Define the Source and Output Directories 

The first step is to define where your input file is located and where you want the output (sorted file) to be saved. You need to specify two paths: one for the source Excel file and another for saving the output after sorting.

```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory\\";
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory\\";
```

## Step 2: Load the Source Excel File

Next, we’ll load the Excel file that contains the data you want to sort. This is done by creating an instance of the `Workbook` class and passing the path of your source file.

```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleSortData_CustomSortList.xlsx");
```

## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet 

Once the file is loaded, we need to access the specific worksheet that contains the data we intend to sort. In this case, we are targeting the first worksheet.

```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 4: Specify the Cell Area to Sort

We need to determine the range of cells that we will sort. In this example, we’ll sort the cells from A1 to A40. Use the `CellArea.CreateCellArea` method to define the cell area.

```csharp
CellArea ca = CellArea.CreateCellArea("A1", "A40");
```

## Step 5: Create a Custom Sort List

Before sorting, we need to establish the criteria we’ll use for our custom sort. You can define a sort list as an array of strings. The custom sort list will dictate the order of sorting.

```csharp
string[] customSortList = new string[] { "USA,US", "Brazil,BR", "China,CN", "Russia,RU", "Canada,CA" };
```

## Step 6: Add Sort Key and Perform the Sort

Now it’s time to sort! We’ll use the DataSorter class for this. Create a key for sorting based on our custom list and execute the sort operation.

```csharp
wb.DataSorter.AddKey(0, SortOrder.Ascending, customSortList);
wb.DataSorter.Sort(ws.Cells, ca);
```

## Step 7: Save the Output Excel File

After sorting is complete, the last step is to save the changes to a new Excel file. Specify the output file name and save the workbook.

```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputSortData_CustomSortList.xlsx");
```

## Step 8: Confirm Successful Execution

To ensure everything has worked smoothly, you can print a confirmation message to the console. This helps in debugging and gives you satisfaction that the operation was successful.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("SortDataInColumnWithCustomSortList executed successfully.\r\n");
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve successfully sorted data in an Excel column using a custom sort list with Aspose.Cells for .NET. Sorting helps bring structure and clarity to your data, making it easier to analyze and interpret. I hope this guide takes your skills to the next level and helps you realize just how powerful Aspose.Cells can be for your Excel-related tasks.
