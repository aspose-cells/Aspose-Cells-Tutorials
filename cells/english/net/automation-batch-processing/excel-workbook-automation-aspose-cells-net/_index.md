Are you looking to automate and streamline your Excel workbook manipulations using .NET? Whether handling complex data sets or managing spreadsheets efficiently, mastering Aspose.Cells for .NET can transform your workflow. This powerful library allows developers to programmatically create, access, and manipulate Excel workbooks effortlessly.

In this tutorial, we'll explore creating workbooks, applying custom cell formatting, utilizing formulas, and more with Aspose.Cells for .NET. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to:
- Create and manage Excel workbooks
- Apply custom cell styles and formulas
- Search values within cells effectively

Let’s get started by setting up your environment.

### Prerequisites
Before we dive into implementation, ensure you have the following:
- **Libraries & Dependencies**: You'll need Aspose.Cells for .NET. Make sure it is installed.
  - IDE: Visual Studio or any compatible C# development environment
  - .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+/6+ setup
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with basic C# programming and Excel operations is recommended.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To integrate Aspose.Cells into your .NET project, follow these steps:

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Package Manager Console**
```powershell
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```
### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Start by downloading a free trial from [Aspose Downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
  - This allows you to explore the full capabilities of Aspose.Cells.
- **Temporary License**: For extended testing, request a temporary license via [Aspose Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: Once you're ready for production, purchase a license from [Aspose Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

After installation and licensing, initialize Aspose.Cells in your project like this:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
// Basic initialization example
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
## Implementation Guide
### Feature 1: Workbook and Worksheet Manipulation
#### Overview
This feature shows how to create a workbook, access worksheets, and manipulate cell values using Aspose.Cells for .NET.
##### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Step 3.1: Create a New Workbook**
Start by initializing a new `Workbook` object:
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
**Step 3.2: Access the First Worksheet**
Accessing worksheets is straightforward:
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0]; // Access first worksheet
```
**Step 3.3: Add Values to Cells**
Add values to specific cells using their addresses:
```csharp
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(10); // Add 10 in cell A1
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(10); // Add 10 in cell A2
```
**Step 3.4: Apply Custom Styles**
Customize the display of a cell:
```csharp
Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["D4"];
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
style.Custom = "---"; // Set custom style to display as ---
cell.SetStyle(style);
```
**Step 3.5: Use Formulas**
Set formulas in cells and calculate results:
```csharp
cell.Formula = "+=Sum(A1:A2)"; // Add Sum formula
workbook.CalculateFormula(); // Calculate the workbook
```
**Step 3.6: Save the Workbook**
Finally, save your changes to an output file:
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
workbook.Save(outputDir + "output_out.xlsx");
```
### Feature 2: Custom Cell Formatting with Formulas
This feature demonstrates applying custom formatting while using formulas.
#### Overview
Here's how you can style cells and apply formulas effectively:
**Step 3.1: Initialize Workbook and Worksheet**
Reuse the initialization steps from Feature 1.
**Step 3.2: Apply Style and Formula to a Cell**
Set a custom display format and formula in one cell:
```csharp
Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["D4"];
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
style.Custom = "---"; // Apply custom formatting as ---
cell.SetStyle(style);
cell.Formula = "+=Sum(A1:A2)"; // Add Sum formula to D4
```
**Step 3.3: Recompute the Workbook**
Recompute the workbook to reflect changes:
```csharp
workbook.CalculateFormula(); // Recompute the workbook
```
**Step 3.4: Save Results**
Save your formatted and calculated workbook.
### Feature 3: Searching Using Original Values in Cells
This feature focuses on searching for values within cells, even with custom formatting applied.
#### Overview
Perform efficient searches using original cell values:
**Step 3.1: Setup Workbook and Worksheet**
As before, initialize the workbook and worksheet.
**Step 3.2: Populate and Format Cells**
Add values and apply styles:
```csharp
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(10);
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(10);

Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["D4"];
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
style.Custom = "---"; // Custom display as ---
cell.SetStyle(style);
```
**Step 3.3: Add Formula**
Set and calculate a formula:
```csharp
cell.Formula = "+=Sum(A1:A2)";
workbook.CalculateFormula(); // Calculate the workbook
```
**Step 3.4: Search for Original Values**
Use `FindOptions` to locate values based on their original content:
```csharp
FindOptions options = new FindOptions();
options.LookInType = LookInType.OriginalValues; // Search using original values
options.LookAtType = LookAtType.EntireContent;

Cell foundCell = worksheet.Cells.Find(20, null, options); // Search for value 20
```
## Practical Applications
Explore how these features can be applied in real-world scenarios:
1. **Financial Reporting**: Automate the generation of financial reports by applying formulas and styles programmatically.
   - Enhance accuracy and efficiency in report generation.
2. **Data Analysis**: Use workbook manipulation to dynamically adjust data sets, enabling advanced analytics.
3. **Automated Auditing**: Implement custom searches to audit large datasets for specific values or anomalies.
4. **Integration with Data Systems**: Seamlessly integrate Excel automation into larger data processing pipelines using Aspose.Cells.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance is crucial when working with extensive Excel manipulations:
