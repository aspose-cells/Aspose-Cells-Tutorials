### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, you can begin using the library by initializing it in your project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
```
This sets up the groundwork for creating workbooks and adding advanced Excel functionalities.

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we will delve into specific features of Aspose.Cells .NET: Workbook Creation, List Object Configuration, and Formula Propagation within tables. Each feature is explained with a step-by-step approach using clear code snippets.

### Feature 1: Workbook Creation and Saving
**Overview:** This feature demonstrates how to create a new workbook, add data to it, and save the file programmatically.

#### Step 1: Initialize Workbook and Worksheet
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Define your output directory here

// Create a new workbook instance
Workbook book = new Workbook();

// Access the first worksheet in the workbook (default created)
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets[0];
```
#### Step 2: Add Data to Worksheet Cells
```csharp
// Populate cells with headers for two columns
sheet.Cells[0, 0].PutValue("Column A");
sheet.Cells[0, 1].PutValue("Column B");
```
#### Step 3: Save the Workbook
```csharp
// Save the workbook as an Excel file
book.Save(outputDir + "outputWorkbookCreationAndSaving.xlsx");
```
**Explanation:** This simple yet powerful feature allows you to automate the process of creating Excel files, providing a foundation for more complex operations.

### Feature 2: List Object Creation and Configuration
**Overview:** Learn how to add a styled list object (table) to your worksheet, enhancing data presentation.

#### Step 1: Add a ListObject to Worksheet
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells.Tables;

// Assuming Workbook 'book' is already initialized
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets[0];

// Define the range for the table and add it as a list object
ListObject listObject = sheet.ListObjects[sheet.ListObjects.Add(0, 0, 1, sheet.Cells.MaxColumn, true)];
```
#### Step 2: Configure ListObject Style
```csharp
// Apply a predefined style to enhance visual appearance
listObject.TableStyleType = TableStyleType.TableStyleMedium2;
listObject.DisplayName = "Table";
```
#### Step 3: Save the Workbook with List Object
```csharp
book.Save(outputDir + "outputListObjectCreationAndConfiguration.xlsx");
```
**Explanation:** Adding a list object allows you to manage data as tables, benefiting from Excel's powerful table features like sorting and filtering.

### Feature 3: Formula Propagation in List Object
**Overview:** Set up formulas that automatically update when new data is added to your table.

#### Step 1: Define Initial Data and Add a ListObject
```csharp
// Assuming Workbook 'book' and Worksheet 'sheet' are initialized

// Populate initial headers for two columns with some values
dateSheet.Cells[0, 0].PutValue("Column A");
sheet.Cells[0, 1].PutValue("Column B");

// Add a list object to the worksheet
ListObject listObject = sheet.ListObjects[sheet.ListObjects.Add(0, 0, 1, sheet.Cells.MaxColumn, true)];
```
#### Step 2: Set Formula for Automatic Calculation
```csharp
// Apply formula in column B that adds 1 to each corresponding value in Column A
listObject.ListColumns[1].Formula = "=[Column A] + 1";
```
#### Step 3: Save the Workbook with Formulas
```csharp
book.Save(outputDir + "outputFormulaPropagation.xlsx");
```
**Explanation:** This feature allows dynamic calculation, ensuring your data remains accurate as it changes over time.
