## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the process into manageable steps to create and style an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

### Creating a New Workbook
**Overview:** Start by instantiating a `Workbook` object, which represents an entire Excel file.
```csharp
// Instantiate a new Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

### Accessing Worksheets and Cells
**Overview:** After creating the workbook, access its worksheets and specific cells to manipulate their content.
```csharp
// Obtain reference to the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Access cell "A1"
Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
```

### Setting Cell Values
**Overview:** Set values for the targeted cell. This example adds text to cell "A1".
```csharp
// Add value to cell "A1"
cell.PutValue("Visit Aspose!");
```

### Applying Style Settings
**Overview:** Customize styles such as text alignment and shrinking to fit.
```csharp
// Retrieve and modify style settings for the cell
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
style.ShrinkToFit = true;
cell.SetStyle(style);
```

### Saving the Workbook
**Overview:** Save your workbook in a desired format, like Excel 97-2003 or newer formats.
```csharp
// Save the workbook as an Excel file
workbook.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/book1.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
```
