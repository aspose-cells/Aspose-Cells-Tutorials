# Control External Resources using Workbook Setting

## Introduction
In the realm of data manipulation and presentation, handling external resources efficiently can be a game-changer. If you're working with Excel files and want to manage external resources seamlessly using Aspose.Cells for .NET, you've landed in the right spot! In this article, we'll dive deep into controlling external resources when working with Excel workbooks. By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to implement a customized solution for loading images and data from external sources effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of coding, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place. Make sure you:
1. Have Visual Studio: You’ll need an IDE to write and test your .NET applications. Visual Studio is the most recommended option due to its extensive support and ease of use.
2. Download Aspose.Cells for .NET: If you haven't already, grab the Aspose.Cells library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). 
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# and .NET framework concepts will make the process smoother for you.
4. Set Up Your Environment: Ensure your project references the Aspose.Cells library. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager within Visual Studio.
5. Sample Files: Have a sample Excel file ready that includes an external resource, such as a linked image. This file will help demonstrate the functionalities we discuss.
Once you're set up with these, you’re ready to delve into controlling external resources with Aspose.Cells.
## Import Packages
To begin coding, you’ll need to import the necessary packages in your C# file. Here’s what you need:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells.Rendering;
using System.Drawing.Imaging;
```
These namespaces provide access to the functionalities required for manipulating Excel files and handling images.
Let's break it down into manageable steps to help you control external resources using `Workbook Settings`. We'll walk through creating a custom stream provider, loading an Excel file, and rendering a worksheet to an image. Feel free to follow along!
## Step 1: Define Source and Output Directories
To start, we need to specify the directories where we’ll read our files from and where we'll save our output. It’s essential to set the correct paths to avoid file not found errors.
```csharp
// Source directory
static string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Output directory
static string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your files are located.
## Step 2: Implement the IStreamProvider Interface
Next, we’ll create a custom class that implements the `IStreamProvider` interface. This class will manage how external resources (like images) are accessed.
```csharp
class SP : IStreamProvider
{
    public void CloseStream(StreamProviderOptions options)
    {
        // Clean up any resources if necessary
    }
    public void InitStream(StreamProviderOptions options)
    {
        // Open the filestream of the external resource
        FileStream fi = new FileStream(sourceDir + "sampleControlExternalResourcesUsingWorkbookSetting_StreamProvider.png", FileMode.OpenOrCreate, FileAccess.Read);
        options.Stream = fi;
    }
}
```
In the `InitStream` method, we open the file that acts as our external resource and assign it to the `Stream` property. This permits the workbook to access the resource when rendering.
## Step 3: Load the Excel File
Now that we have our stream provider ready, let’s load the Excel workbook that contains the external resource.
```csharp
public static void Run()
{
    // Load sample Excel file
    Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleControlExternalResourcesUsingWorkbookSetting_StreamProvider.xlsx");
    
    // Provide your implementation of IStreamProvider
    wb.Settings.StreamProvider = new SP();
```
In this snippet, we load our Excel file and assign our custom `StreamProvider` implementation to handle external resources.
## Step 4: Access the Worksheet
After loading the workbook, we can easily access the desired worksheet. Let's grab the first one.
```csharp
    // Access first worksheet
    Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
It’s straightforward, isn’t it? You can access any worksheet by specifying its index.
## Step 5: Configure Image or Print Options
Now we’ll define how we want the output image to look. We’ll configure options like ensuring that there’s one page for each sheet and specifying the output image type.
```csharp
    // Specify image or print options
    ImageOrPrintOptions opts = new ImageOrPrintOptions();
    opts.OnePagePerSheet = true;
    opts.ImageType = Drawing.ImageType.Png;
```
Choosing PNG as the output format makes sure that the quality remains crisp and clear!
## Step 6: Render the Worksheet to an Image
With everything set up, let’s render our chosen worksheet to an image file! This is the exciting part; you’ll see your Excel sheet transformed into a beautiful image.
```csharp
    // Create sheet render by passing required parameters
    SheetRender sr = new SheetRender(ws, opts);
    // Convert your entire worksheet into png image
    sr.ToImage(0, outputDir + "outputControlExternalResourcesUsingWorkbookSetting_StreamProvider.png");
    
    Console.WriteLine("ControlExternalResourcesUsingWorkbookSetting_StreamProvider executed successfully.");
}
```
The `ToImage` function does all the heavy lifting, converting the sheet to an image. Once this step is complete, you'll find the image saved to your output directory.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You now possess the know-how to control external resources when working with Excel files using Aspose.Cells in .NET. This not only enhances your application’s capabilities but also makes handling datasets and presentations a beach walk. By following the steps provided, you can easily replicate and adapt this functionality to fit your project's specific needs.
