# Specify Author while Write Protecting Workbook using Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
When it comes to managing Excel files programmatically, one library stands out: Aspose.Cells for .NET. This powerful tool lets you manipulate Excel files effortlessly, whether you're creating spreadsheets from scratch or enhancing existing ones. In this guide, we'll take a closer look at how to write-protect a workbook while specifying an author for that protection. This feature is particularly useful if you're collaborating with others and need to control access to your documents while maintaining accountability.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, there are a few prerequisites you need to prepare:
1. .NET Environment: Ensure you have a .NET development environment set up. You can use Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: You’ll need to have the Aspose.Cells library referenced in your project. You can download it via the link below:
- [Download Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/)
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will significantly help you follow this guide, as we’ll be writing code examples.
4. An Executable Project Setup: Make sure you have a basic console application or a Windows Forms application ready for your testing.
5. Trial License (Optional): If you want to explore all features without restrictions, consider obtaining a temporary license from [Aspose](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
Now that you have everything in place, let’s move forward!
## Import Packages
To begin, we’ll need to import the necessary packages for the Aspose.Cells library. Add the following namespace at the top of your code file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
This import allows us to access the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.Cells API.
In this section, we will break down the process into clear, manageable steps. Let’s go through each step together!
## Step 1: Define Your Directories
It's essential to set up the file paths for both the source and output directories. This will determine where your files will be read from and saved to. Here’s how to define them:
```csharp
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where you want your files to be stored. This setup makes it easy to manage file locations later in the process.
## Step 2: Create an Empty Workbook
Now it's time to create a new, empty workbook. This workbook will act as the foundation for our project.
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
When you instantiate a `Workbook` object, you're creating a new Excel file in memory. You can now start manipulating this workbook as needed.
## Step 3: Write Protect the Workbook with a Password
To ensure that no unwanted changes are made to the workbook, we’ll apply write protection using a password. Let’s set it up:
```csharp
wb.Settings.WriteProtection.Password = "1234";
```
In the line above, we’re setting the password to `"1234"`. Feel free to choose a stronger password for better security.
## Step 4: Specify the Author for Write Protection
Here’s the step we’ve all been waiting for—designating an author while writing protection! This adds a layer of accountability and transparency.
```csharp
wb.Settings.WriteProtection.Author = "SimonAspose";
```
By specifying the author, you’re indicating who is responsible for setting up the write protection. This is particularly useful in team environments where multiple people might interact with the workbook.
## Step 5: Save the Workbook in XLSX Format
The final step is to save your changes to a file in the desired format—XLSX in this case:
```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputSpecifyAuthorWhileWriteProtectingWorkbook.xlsx");
```
The `Save` method commits all your changes to the file system, creating an actual workbook that you (or anyone with the password) can later open and use.
## Step 6: Confirm Successful Execution
Lastly, it's always good practice to confirm that your code executed as expected:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("SpecifyAuthorWhileWriteProtectingWorkbook executed successfully.");
```
This simple line lets you know in the console that everything worked flawlessly. It’s a nice touch, especially for debugging purposes!
## Conclusion
In summary, specifying an author while write protecting a workbook in Aspose.Cells for .NET is a simple yet effective way to maintain control over your Excel files. With just a few lines of code, you can not only protect your workbook from unauthorized edits but also ensure accountability by tying the protection to a specific author. Whether you're working solo or as part of a team, this functionality is invaluable for maintaining document integrity and collaboration ethics.
