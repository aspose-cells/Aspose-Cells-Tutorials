# Save Excel File in 97-2003 Format

## Introduction
Creating and managing Excel files programmatically can be a game-changer, especially for businesses that heavily rely on data manipulation. One of the great tools available for .NET developers is Aspose.Cells. It's versatile and powerful, helping you streamline workflows and automate tasks with spreadsheets. If you're looking to save Excel files in the classic 97-2003 format, you’ve come to the right place! Let’s dive in.
## Prerequisites
Before we plunge into the nitty-gritty, there are a few prerequisites you'll need to tick off your list:
1. Basic Understanding of .NET: Familiarity with C# or VB.NET will be immensely helpful.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library installed in your project. If you haven't yet, you can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Visual Studio: A development environment like Visual Studio or any .NET compatible IDE will facilitate coding and debugging.
4. NuGet Package Manager: For the easiest installation of Aspose.Cells in your project. 
Once you're set up with these prerequisites, we’re ready to roll!
## Import Packages
To get started with Aspose.Cells, you’ll first need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This will give you access to classes and methods required to manipulate Excel files. Here’s how:
### Open Your Project
Open your .NET project in Visual Studio.
### Install Aspose.Cells
If you haven’t already installed the Aspose.Cells package, you can do this via NuGet. 
1. Go to Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet Packages for Solution.
2. Search for Aspose.Cells.
3. Click on Install.
### Import the Namespace
At the top of your C# file, include the following line:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
Now you're ready to start coding!
In this section, we will guide you through the process of saving an Excel file in the 97-2003 format (.xls) using Aspose.Cells. Let’s break it down into easy-to-follow steps.
## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory
First things first! You'll need to establish the directory where your Excel file will be saved.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
- `"Your Document Directory"`: Replace this placeholder string with the actual path where you want your Excel file to be saved. It could be something like `"C:\\ExcelFiles\\"`.
## Step 2: Create a New Workbook Object
Next up, let’s create a new instance of the `Workbook` class. This is where all the magic happens!
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
- `Workbook`: This class represents the Excel file you're working with. By instantiating it, you're essentially creating a fresh blank workbook.
## Step 3: Save the Workbook in 97-2003 Format
This is the moment you've been waiting for! It's time to save your workbook. There are two ways you can do this.
### Simple Save
Use the following code to save your file directly to the specified path.
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
### Save with Format Specified
You can also specify the save format explicitly:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
```
- `output.xls`: This is the name of the file you’re saving. You can rename it as per your requirement.
- `SaveFormat.Excel97To2003`: This ensures that your file is saved in the Excel 97-2003 format.
## Conclusion
And there you have it – a straightforward tutorial on saving Excel files in the classic 97-2003 format using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you're building financial reports or maintaining data logs, this approach can simplify your work and enhance productivity. Have fun exploring the capabilities of this powerful library!
