# Save Excel File in 2007 xlsb Format

## Introduction
When it comes to working with Excel files in .NET, there’s a lot of flexibility and functionality available, especially with the Aspose.Cells library. This powerful tool allows you to create, modify, and save Excel files effortlessly. Today, we’re going to explore how to save an Excel file in the 2007 xlsb format. If you've been looking for a way to handle Excel files programmatically without the typical overhead, you're in the right place! 
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, let's ensure you have everything you need to follow along seamlessly. Here’s what you should have:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have a version of Visual Studio installed on your machine. This is where you'll be writing your .NET code. 
2. Aspose.Cells Library: You need the Aspose.Cells for .NET library. If you haven't already downloaded it, head over to the [Aspose Downloads page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) to grab it. 
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A foundational understanding of C# and .NET will help you navigate through the code examples more comfortably.
4. .NET Framework: Ensure your project is set up with the appropriate .NET framework supported by the Aspose.Cells library.
5. An Excel Document: While creating a new workbook is an option, having a starting document could be useful if you want to manipulate an existing file.
## Import Packages
To start using the Aspose.Cells library in your project, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. This is similar to unpacking your toolbox before starting a project.
### Set Up Your Project
1. Open Visual Studio: Start a new project by selecting ‘Create a new project’. 
2. Choose a Project Template: Pick a Console Application or a Windows Forms Application, depending on your preference.
3. Add the Aspose.Cells Reference: Right-click on "References" in your project explorer, then click "Add Reference." Browse to the Aspose.Cells.dll file you downloaded.
### Import the Namespace
Once you have the reference added, the next step is to include the namespace at the top of your C# file.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
This line of code allows you to access all the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.Cells library without qualification.

Now, let’s break down the steps to save an Excel file in the 2007 xlsb format.
## Step 1: Set the Save Directory
First, we need to establish where our Excel file will be saved.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory\\";
```
This line defines the path to your documents directory. Ensure you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path on your system where you want to save the file.
## Step 2: Create a Workbook Object
Next, we will create a new workbook using the Aspose.Cells library.

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
Here, we’re creating a new instance of the `Workbook` class. This newly created workbook is a blank workbook that you can start populating with data if you wish.
## Step 3: Save the Workbook
Now comes the fun part—saving your workbook in the desired format!
```csharp
// Save in Excel2007 xlsb format
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xlsb", SaveFormat.Xlsb);
```
This line of code saves your workbook as `output.xlsb` in the specified directory using the `SaveFormat.Xlsb` format. The `SaveFormat` enumeration is powerful in that it allows you to specify various formats like `Xlsx`, `Xls`, etc.
## Conclusion
And just like that, you’ve successfully learned how to save an Excel file in the 2007 xlsb format using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This simple yet effective functionality can be a game-changer for developers needing to automate Excel file handling in their .NET applications.
