//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to create a PDF from an Excel chart with a specified page size. It loads an Excel workbook, accesses a worksheet and its chart, and finally generates a PDF file with the desired layout.
//ExStepSummary:0: This step defines the source directory where the Excel file is stored.
//ExStepSummary:1: This step defines the output directory where the generated PDF will be saved.
//ExStepSummary:2: This step loads the sample Excel file containing the chart into a Workbook object.
//ExStepSummary:3: This step accesses the first worksheet of the loaded workbook.
//ExStepSummary:4: This step accesses the first chart present in the worksheet.
//ExStepSummary:5: This step creates a PDF of the chart with a specified page size and alignment, and saves it to the output directory.
//ExStepSummary:6: This step outputs a confirmation message indicating successful execution of the creation process.
