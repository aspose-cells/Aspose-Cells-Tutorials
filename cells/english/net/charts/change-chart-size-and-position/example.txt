//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to resize and reposition a chart in an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells library.
//ExStepSummary:0: The following code initializes source and output directories for the Excel file.
//ExStepSummary:1: The code loads a workbook from the source directory containing a sample Excel file.
//ExStepSummary:2: The code accesses the first worksheet in the workbook to work with its charts.
//ExStepSummary:3: The code retrieves the first chart from the worksheet for modification purposes.
//ExStepSummary:4: The code resizes the chart to a width of 400 and height of 300 pixels.
//ExStepSummary:5: The code repositions the chart by setting its X and Y coordinates.
//ExStepSummary:6: Finally, the modified workbook is saved to the output directory with a new filename.

//ExStep:0-
// Source directory for the Excel file
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Output directory for saving the modified Excel file
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Load the specified workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleChangeChartSizeAndPosition.xlsx");

//ExStep:2-
// Access the first worksheet of the workbook
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//ExStep:3-
// Load the first chart from the worksheet
Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[0];

//ExStep:4-
// Resize the chart width to 400 pixels
chart.ChartObject.Width = 400;
// Resize the chart height to 300 pixels
chart.ChartObject.Height = 300;

//ExStep:5-
// Reposition the chart's X coordinate
chart.ChartObject.X = 250;
// Reposition the chart's Y coordinate 
chart.ChartObject.Y = 150;

//ExStep:6-
// Save the modified workbook to the output directory
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputChangeChartSizeAndPosition.xlsx");
// Notify the user of successful execution
Console.WriteLine("ChangeChartSizeAndPosition executed successfully.");
