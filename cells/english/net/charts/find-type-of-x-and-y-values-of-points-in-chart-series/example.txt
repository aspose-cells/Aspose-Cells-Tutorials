//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to load an Excel file containing a chart, access the chart, calculate its data, 
// and retrieve the types of X and Y values from a specific chart point. It prints these types to the console.
//ExStepSummary:0: Load the sample Excel file that contains the chart data.
//ExStepSummary:1: Access the first worksheet in the workbook.
//ExStepSummary:2: Access the first chart in the worksheet.
//ExStepSummary:3: Calculate the data for the chart.
//ExStepSummary:4: Retrieve the first chart point from the first series of the chart.
//ExStepSummary:5: Print the types of X and Y values to the console.
//ExStepSummary:6: Confirm the successful execution of the process.
