//ExStart
//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to load an existing Excel workbook, access a chart, and retrieve the types of X and Y values of its data points.
//ExStepSummary:0: This step defines the source directory where the Excel document is located.
//ExStepSummary:1: This step loads a sample Excel file containing a chart into a Workbook object.
//ExStepSummary:2: This step accesses the first worksheet in the workbook to work with its contents.
//ExStepSummary:3: This step retrieves the first chart present in the worksheet for analysis.
//ExStepSummary:4: This step computes the data points and formulas used in the chart for accurate data retrieval.
//ExStepSummary:5: This step retrieves the first data point from the first series of the chart to examine its properties.
//ExStepSummary:6: This step prints out the types of X and Y values associated with the retrieved chart point, providing insights into the data's format.
//ExStepSummary:7: This step confirms the successful execution of the operation by outputting a success message to the console.
