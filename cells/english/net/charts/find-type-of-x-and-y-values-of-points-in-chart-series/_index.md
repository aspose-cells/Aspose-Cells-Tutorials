# Find Type of X and Y Values in Chart Points Using Aspose.Cells  

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to determine the types of X and Y values for chart points in an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This is useful when analyzing chart data dynamically within a .NET application. We’ll start by loading an Excel file containing a chart, access the worksheet and chart, calculate the chart data, and extract value types from a specific data point. Finally, we’ll print these values to the console for verification.  

Aspose.Cells for .NET makes it easy to work with Excel charts programmatically, enabling developers to automate complex spreadsheet operations without requiring Microsoft Excel.
