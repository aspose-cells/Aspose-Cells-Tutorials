//ExStep:0-
// Define the source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Define the output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Load the source Excel file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleSetShapeTypeOfDataLabelsOfChart.xlsx");

//ExStep:2-
// Access the first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
// Access the first chart
Chart ch = ws.Charts[0]; 

//ExStep:3-
// Access the first series
Series srs = ch.NSeries[0];
// Set the shape type of data labels to Speech Bubble Oval
