# Load Visible Sheets Only from Excel File

## Introduction
When you're working with Excel files in your .NET applications, the challenge of managing multiple worksheets becomes apparent, especially when some are hidden or not relevant to your operation. Aspose.Cells for .NET is a powerful library that helps you manipulate Excel files efficiently. In this article, we’ll explore how to load only the visible sheets from an Excel file, filtering out any hidden data. If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by navigating your Excel data, this guide is for you!
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, let’s make sure you have everything you need to follow along:
1. Basic Understanding of C#: This tutorial is designed for developers familiar with C# programming language.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You must have the Aspose.Cells for .NET library downloaded and set up. You can [download the library here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Visual Studio or Any IDE: You should have an IDE where you can write and test your C# code.
4. .NET Framework: Ensure that you have the necessary .NET Framework installed to run your applications.
5. A Sample Excel File: For practice, create a sample Excel file or follow along with the code provided.
Got everything ready? Awesome! Let’s get into it!
## Import Packages
One of the first steps in any C# project working with Aspose.Cells is importing the required packages. This enables you to access all the functionalities provided by the library. Here’s how to do it:
1. Open Your Project: Start by opening your C# project in Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.
2. Add References: Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, select "Add," and then "Reference." 
3. Browse for Aspose.Cells: Locate the Aspose.Cells.dll file you downloaded earlier and add it to your project references.
This step is crucial since it links the Aspose.Cells functionality to your project. 
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

Now that you've imported the necessary packages, we’ll create a sample Excel workbook. In this workbook, we will have multiple sheets, and one of them will be hidden for this tutorial.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
First, let's set up the environment and specify the paths for the sample file.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string sampleFile = "output.xlsx";
string samplePath = dataDir + sampleFile;
```
In this code snippet, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where you want to save your workbook. 
## Step 2: Create the Workbook
Next, let's create the workbook and add some data.
```csharp
// Create a sample workbook
Workbook createWorkbook = new Workbook();
createWorkbook.Worksheets["Sheet1"].Cells["A1"].Value = "Aspose";
createWorkbook.Worksheets.Add("Sheet2").Cells["A1"].Value = "Aspose";
createWorkbook.Worksheets.Add("Sheet3").Cells["A1"].Value = "Aspose";
createWorkbook.Worksheets["Sheet3"].IsVisible = false; // Make Sheet3 hidden
createWorkbook.Save(samplePath);
```
Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening:
- We're creating a new workbook and adding three sheets.
- “Sheet1” and “Sheet2” will be visible, while “Sheet3” will be hidden.
- We then save the workbook to the specified path.
## Step 3: Load the Sample Workbook with Load Options
Now that we have a workbook with visible and hidden sheets, it’s time to load it while ensuring we only access the visible sheets.
```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.LoadFilter = new CustomLoad();
```
This code snippet sets up the loading options for the workbook, which we'll customize to filter out hidden sheets.
## Step 4: Define the Custom Load Filter
To only load visible sheets, we need to create a custom loading filter. Here's how to define it:
```csharp
class CustomLoad : LoadFilter
{
    public override void StartSheet(Worksheet sheet)
    {
        if (sheet.IsVisible)
        {
            this.LoadDataFilterOptions = LoadDataFilterOptions.All;
        }
        else
        {
            this.LoadDataFilterOptions = LoadDataFilterOptions.Structure;
        }
    }
}
```
- The `StartSheet` method checks if each sheet is visible.
- If it is visible, it loads all data from that sheet.
- If it is not visible, it skips loading any data from that sheet.
## Step 5: Load the Workbook Using the Load Options
Now let’s load the workbook and display the data from the visible sheets.
```csharp
Workbook loadWorkbook = new Workbook(samplePath, loadOptions);
Console.WriteLine("Sheet1: A1: {0}", loadWorkbook.Worksheets["Sheet1"].Cells["A1"].Value);
Console.WriteLine("Sheet2: A1: {0}", loadWorkbook.Worksheets["Sheet2"].Cells["A1"].Value);
```
This code snippet utilizes the `loadOptions` to only import data from the visible sheets and displays the content of cell A1 from “Sheet1” and “Sheet2.” 
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You've successfully learned how to load only visible sheets from an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Managing your Excel worksheets can be a breeze when you know how to limit the data you retrieve and work with only what you need. This not only improves the efficiency of your applications but also makes your code cleaner and easier to manage.
