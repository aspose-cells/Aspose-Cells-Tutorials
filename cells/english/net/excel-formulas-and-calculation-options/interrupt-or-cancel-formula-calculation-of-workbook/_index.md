# Interrupt or Cancel Formula Calculation of Workbook

## Introduction
Are you tired of your Excel calculations running longer than they should? There are times when you might want to stop or interrupt a lengthy formula calculation in your workbook. Whether you're dealing with extensive datasets or complex formulas, knowing how to control this process can save you a lot of time and hassle. In this article, we’ll walk you through how to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to effectively interrupt or cancel formula calculations in your Excel workbooks. 
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into our tutorial, let's make sure you have everything set up:
1. Visual Studio: You need to have Visual Studio installed on your machine. Any version that supports .NET development will do.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Cells library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be beneficial as we’ll write code snippets together.
4. An Excel file: For this tutorial, we’ll reference a sample Excel file named `sampleCalculationMonitor.xlsx`. Make sure you have it available in your homework directory.
Once you have all these in place, we can jump right into the code!
## Import Packages
In your Visual Studio project, you will need to import several namespaces related to Aspose.Cells. Here are the packages you’ll want to include at the top of your code file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
By including these namespaces, you'll gain access to the necessary classes and methods to manipulate Excel workbooks.
Now that you’re all set with the prerequisites and packages, let’s break down the task into manageable steps. Each step will carry a heading and a concise explanation.
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Workbook
First, you need to load your workbook. This is the file that contains the calculations you may want to interrupt. Here’s how:
```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Update with your actual directory path.
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleCalculationMonitor.xlsx");
```
In this step, we create a `Workbook` instance by pointing it to our Excel file. This sets the stage for all further actions.
## Step 2: Create Calculation Options
Next, we’ll create a calculation option and pair it with a calculation monitor class. This is crucial for controlling how our calculations run.
```csharp
CalculationOptions opts = new CalculationOptions();
opts.CalculationMonitor = new clsCalculationMonitor();
```
Here, we instantiate `CalculationOptions` and assign `clsCalculationMonitor` — a custom class we will define next. This will allow us to monitor calculations and apply interruptions.
## Step 3: Implement the Calculation Monitor
Now, let’s create our `clsCalculationMonitor` class. This class will inherit from `AbstractCalculationMonitor` and will contain our logic to interrupt calculations.
```csharp
class clsCalculationMonitor : AbstractCalculationMonitor
{
    public override void BeforeCalculate(int sheetIndex, int rowIndex, int colIndex)
    {
        // Find the cell name
        string cellName = CellsHelper.CellIndexToName(rowIndex, colIndex);
        // Print the sheet, row and column index as well as cell name
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(sheetIndex + "----" + rowIndex + "----" + colIndex + "----" + cellName);
        // If cell name is B8, interrupt/cancel the formula calculation
        if (cellName == "B8")
        {
            this.Interrupt("Interrupt/Cancel the formula calculation");
        } // if
    } // BeforeCalculate
} // clsCalculationMonitor
```
In this class, we override the `BeforeCalculate` method, which is triggered before any cell calculation. We check if the current cell is `B8`. If it is, we call `this.Interrupt()` to stop the calculation.
## Step 4: Calculate the Formula with Options
With our options and monitor in place, it’s time to perform the calculation:
```csharp
wb.CalculateFormula(opts);
```
This command will carry out the calculations while monitoring for interruptions. If the calculation reaches B8, it will halt as per our previous logic.
## Conclusion
Congratulate yourself! You've just learned how to interrupt formula calculations in Excel workbooks using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This process gives you better control over your calculations, ensuring they don’t drag on unnecessarily. 
Whether you’re developing complex financial models or crunching big datasets, being able to manage your calculations can greatly enhance performance and usability. I hope this tutorial has provided value and clarity on the subject. Don't forget to explore further in Aspose.Cells documentation to discover even more capabilities.
