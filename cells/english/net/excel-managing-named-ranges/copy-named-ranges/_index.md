# Copy Named Ranges in Excel

## Introduction
Excel is a powerful tool used by millions worldwide for data organization and analysis. But when it comes to programmatically manipulating Excel files—like copying named ranges—it can get a bit tricky. Thankfully, Aspose.Cells for .NET makes this task easy and efficient. This article will walk you through the process of copying named ranges in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET, explained in a step-by-step manner, so you can follow along with ease.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the nitty-gritty of copying named ranges, you’ll need to ensure you have a few things lined up. Here’s what you need:
1. .NET Environment: Make sure you have a .NET development environment set up. You can use Visual Studio or any other IDE of your choice.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: This is the star of the show! Download the library from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) if you haven’t done so already.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will be beneficial as we’ll be coding in this language throughout the tutorial.
4. Excel Installed: While you don’t necessarily need Excel to write code, having it installed is useful for testing your output files.
5. Access to Documentation: Bookmark the [Aspose.Cells Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/) for reference. It’s a great resource for understanding methods and features.
Now that you're equipped with the essentials, let's dive into the code!
## Import Packages
To start using Aspose.Cells, you must import the necessary namespaces into your project. This will allow you to access the classes provided by the Aspose.Cells library.
### Import the Namespace
Here’s how to import the Aspose.Cells namespace:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
```
This code will give you access to essential classes such as `Workbook`, `Worksheet`, and `Range`, which you will need to manipulate Excel files.

Now that we have our prerequisites sorted, let's break down the process into easy-to-follow steps.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Output Directory
First, you'll want to define where your resulting Excel file will be saved. It’s like setting your mailbox before receiving a letter!
```csharp
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory\\"; // Make sure to use double backslashes for directory paths
```
## Step 2: Create a New Workbook
Next, you need to instantiate a new workbook, which is like opening a new spreadsheet in Excel. 
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
This command creates a new Excel file that we can now modify.
## Step 3: Access the Worksheets
Once you have your workbook, you can access the worksheets it contains. 
```csharp
WorksheetCollection worksheets = workbook.Worksheets;
```
Think of worksheets as individual pages within your workbook. You can have multiple pages to organize your data.
## Step 4: Select the First Worksheet
Let’s grab the first worksheet from our collection. This is where we will create and manipulate ranges.
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
## Step 5: Create and Name Your First Range
Now, it’s time to create a named range. You’ll create it by defining a section of cells in the worksheet.
```csharp
Range range1 = worksheet.Cells.CreateRange("E12", "I12");
range1.Name = "MyRange";
```
Here, we’ve created a range from cells E12 to I12 and given it the name "MyRange". Naming ranges is essential as it allows you to reference them easily later.
## Step 6: Set Outline Borders for the Range
Next, let’s add some styling to our range by setting outline borders. This makes your data visually appealing!
```csharp
range1.SetOutlineBorder(BorderType.TopBorder, CellBorderType.Medium, Color.FromArgb(0, 0, 128));
range1.SetOutlineBorder(BorderType.BottomBorder, CellBorderType.Medium, Color.FromArgb(0, 0, 128));
range1.SetOutlineBorder(BorderType.LeftBorder, CellBorderType.Medium, Color.FromArgb(0, 0, 128));
range1.SetOutlineBorder(BorderType.RightBorder, CellBorderType.Medium, Color.FromArgb(0, 0, 128));
```
In this snippet, we’ve set the top, bottom, left, and right borders to be medium and colored navy blue. Visual organization is just as important as data organization!
## Step 7: Input Data into the Range
Now it’s time to populate our range with some data. 
```csharp
range1[0, 0].PutValue("Test");
range1[0, 4].PutValue("123");
```
This piece of code fills the first cell of the range with the text "Test" and the last cell with the number "123". It's like filling out a form with essential information.
## Step 8: Create Another Range
Next, you need another range where you’ll copy the data from your first range.
```csharp
Range range2 = worksheet.Cells.CreateRange("B3", "F3");
range2.Name = "testrange"; // Naming the second range
```
This step creates a range from B3 to F3, which we'll use to copy the contents of "MyRange".
## Step 9: Copy the Named Range to the Second Range
Now comes the exciting part—copying the data from the first range to the second range!
```csharp
range2.Copy(range1);
```
This command effectively transfers your data from "MyRange" to "testrange". It’s like making a photocopy of an important document—easy and efficient!
## Step 10: Save the Workbook
Finally, save your workbook to the specified output directory.
```csharp
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputCopyNamedRanges.xlsx");
```
This line saves the workbook, embedding all of your changes, to a file named "outputCopyNamedRanges.xlsx". It’s the grand finale of your coding efforts!
## Step 11: Confirm Execution
You can provide feedback to the console to confirm everything went smoothly.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("CopyNamedRanges executed successfully.");
```
Running this line will indicate that your code executed without any hitches.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully copied named ranges in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET, step-by-step. This process allows you to automate your Excel tasks and manage your data more effectively. With a little practice, you’ll be able to run more sophisticated Excel automation tasks in no time.
