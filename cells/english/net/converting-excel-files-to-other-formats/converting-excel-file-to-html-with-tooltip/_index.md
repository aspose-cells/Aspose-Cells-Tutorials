# Converting Excel File to HTML with Tooltip in .NET

## Introduction

This is a perfect solution for web applications that need to display data from Excel files in a browser-friendly format. We'll break it down step-by-step, so even if you’re new to Aspose.Cells, you’ll feel confident by the end of this tutorial. Ready to dive in?

## Prerequisites

Before we start coding, let’s make sure we have everything we need:

- Aspose.Cells for .NET: This is the core library that allows us to work with Excel files programmatically. You can download it from the [Aspose.Cells Download Link](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
- Development Environment: A Windows or Mac environment with Visual Studio installed.
- .NET Framework: Ensure you have at least .NET Framework 4.0 or higher installed.
- License: You can either apply a [Temporary License](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) or purchase a full one from [Aspose Buy Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

## Import Packages

Before diving into the code, let's import the necessary namespaces and packages into our project. These are the packages that provide all the functionality for working with Excel files in Aspose.Cells.

```csharp
using System;
```

Let’s walk through each step of the process to convert an Excel file to HTML with tooltips.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

First things first: we need to create a .NET project and reference Aspose.Cells. Here’s how you can get started:

- Open Visual Studio.
- Create a new Console App (.NET Framework) project.
- Add the Aspose.Cells DLL to your project. You can either download it manually from the [Aspose.Cells Download Link](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) or install it via NuGet by running the following command in your NuGet Package Manager Console:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

This adds the Aspose.Cells library to your project, which gives you the power to manipulate Excel files programmatically.

## Step 2: Loading the Excel File

Now that your project is set up, it’s time to load the Excel file that you want to convert. The file could contain any data – perhaps product information or sales reports – but for this example, we’ll load a sample file named `AddTooltipToHtmlSample.xlsx`.

Here's how you can load the file:

```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Open the template file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "AddTooltipToHtmlSample.xlsx");
```

In this step, we’re using the `Workbook` class to open the Excel file. The `Workbook` class is at the heart of Aspose.Cells, providing all the methods you need to handle Excel files.

## Step 3: Configuring HTML Save Options

Before we convert the Excel file into HTML, we need to configure the saving options. In this case, we want to ensure that tooltips are included in the HTML output. This is where the `HtmlSaveOptions` class comes in.

Here’s how we configure the options:

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions();
options.AddTooltipText = true;
```

By setting the `AddTooltipText` property to `true`, we ensure that tooltips will be displayed when users hover over cells in the HTML output.

## Step 4: Saving the Excel File as HTML

With our options configured, the final step is to save the Excel file as HTML. We’ll specify the output directory and file name, and then call the `Save` method on the `Workbook` object to generate the HTML file.

```csharp
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Save as HTML with tooltips
workbook.Save(outputDir + "AddTooltipToHtmlSample_out.html", options);
```

This code converts the Excel file into an HTML document with tooltips enabled. Simple, right? And you’re done with the heavy lifting!

## Step 5: Running the Application

To execute the program, hit `F5` in Visual Studio. Once the code runs successfully, check the output directory for the HTML file. Open it in any browser, and voila! Hover over any cell in the table to see the tooltips in action.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! Converting an Excel file to HTML with tooltips using Aspose.Cells for .NET is as easy as 1-2-3. Whether you’re building a web app or just need a quick way to convert your data into a web-friendly format, this method will save you tons of time.
