//ExStep:0-
// Define path to the documents directory
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Check if directory exists
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir); 
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:2-
// Instantiate a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(); 

//ExStep:3-
// Add a new worksheet to the Workbook
int sheetIndex = workbook.Worksheets.Add(); 
// Get reference to the newly added worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[sheetIndex];

//ExStep:4-
// Add an image to cell "F6" (row 5, column 5)
worksheet.Pictures.Add(5, 5, dataDir + "logo.jpg");

//ExStep:5-
// Save the Excel file to the specified path
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
