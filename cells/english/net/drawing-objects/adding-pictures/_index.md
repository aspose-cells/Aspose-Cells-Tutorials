## Installation Instructions
1. Install Aspose.Cells: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library installed. You can do this using NuGet Package Manager by running:
   ```
   Install-Package Aspose.Cells

2. Setup your Environment: Create a directory on your machine where you want to store the generated Excel files. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` in the example with your actual directory path.
3. Implement the Code: Copy the provided example code into your .NET application. Ensure you update the image path (`dataDir + "logo.jpg"`) to point to an existing image you want to insert into the Excel file.
4. Run the Application: Execute your application. The code will create a new Excel file named `output.xls` in the specified directory, with an image placed in cell "F6".
