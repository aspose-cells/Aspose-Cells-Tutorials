//ExStart
//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to access and modify the label of an Ole object in an Excel file using Aspose.Cells.
//ExStepSummary:0: The following code initializes the source directory where the Excel file is located.
//ExStepSummary:1: The code loads the sample Excel file into a Workbook object.
//ExStepSummary:2: This step accesses the first worksheet in the workbook.
//ExStepSummary:3: Here, the first Ole object is accessed for modification.
//ExStepSummary:4: The original label of the Ole object is displayed in the console.
//ExStepSummary:5: The label of the Ole object is modified.
//ExStepSummary:6: The updated workbook is saved to a memory stream.
//ExStepSummary:7: The workbook reference is set to null to release resources.
//ExStepSummary:8: The workbook is reloaded from the memory stream to verify the changes.
//ExStepSummary:9: The modified label of the Ole object is displayed after reloading.
//ExStepSummary:10: A success message is displayed in the console to indicate execution completion.

//ExStep:0-
// Specify the directory containing the Excel file
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Load the sample Excel file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleAccessAndModifyLabelOfOleObject.xlsx");

//ExStep:2-
// Access the first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];

//ExStep:3-
// Access the first Ole object
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.OleObject oleObject = ws.OleObjects[0];

//ExStep:4-
// Display the original label of the Ole object
Console.WriteLine("Ole Object Label - Before: " + oleObject.Label);

//ExStep:5-
// Modify the label of the Ole object
oleObject.Label = "Aspose APIs";

//ExStep:6-
// Create a memory stream to save the workbook
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
// Save workbook to memory stream
wb.Save(ms, SaveFormat.Xlsx);

//ExStep:7-
// Set the workbook reference to null to release resources
wb = null; 

//ExStep:8-
// Load workbook from the memory stream
wb = new Workbook(ms);
ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
oleObject = ws.OleObjects[0];

//ExStep:9-
// Display the modified label of the Ole object
Console.WriteLine("Ole Object Label - After: " + oleObject.Label); 

//ExStep:10-
// Indicate successful execution
Console.WriteLine("AccessAndModifyLabelOfOleObject executed successfully.");
