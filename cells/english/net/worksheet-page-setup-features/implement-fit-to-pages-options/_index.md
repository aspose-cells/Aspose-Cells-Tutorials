# Implement Fit to Pages Options in Worksheet

## Introduction
When working with spreadsheets, one of the most common concerns is how to make sure your data looks great when printed or shared. You want your colleagues, clients, or students to have an easy time reading your data without having to scroll through endless pages. Luckily, Aspose.Cells for .NET provides a simple way to make your spreadsheets print-ready by using the Fit to Pages options. In this guide, we’ll explore how you can easily implement this feature in your Excel workbooks. 
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the code, there are a few things you should have in place to ensure a smooth ride through this tutorial:
1. Visual Studio: First things first, you need an IDE where you can write your .NET code. Visual Studio Community Edition is free and is a fantastic choice.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You need to have the Aspose.Cells library installed in your project. You can easily get it through NuGet Package Manager. Just search for "Aspose.Cells" and install it. For more details, you can check the [Documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: While I’ll explain everything step-by-step, having some foundational knowledge in C# will be helpful.
4. A Directory for Your Files: You’ll also need a directory to save your modified Excel files. Plan ahead so you know where to look once your work is finished.
Once you have everything in place, let’s get started!
## Import Packages
Now, let’s talk about importing the necessary packages. In C#, you need to include specific namespaces to utilize the features offered by Aspose.Cells. Here’s how you do it:
### Create a New C# File
Open your Visual Studio, create a new console project, and add a new C# file. You can name this file `FitToPageExample.cs`.
### Import the Aspose.Cells Namespace
At the top of your file, you need to import the Aspose.Cells namespace, which gives you access to the workbook and worksheet classes. Add this line of code:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
That's it! You're all set to start coding.
Let’s break down the implementation into simple, digestible steps. We’ll go through each action you need to perform to set the Fit to Pages options in your worksheet.
## Step 1: Define the Path to Your Documents Directory
Before you start working with anything, you need to define where your files will be saved.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where you want to store your modified Excel file.
## Step 2: Instantiate a Workbook Object
Next, you’ll need to create an instance of the Workbook class. This class represents your Excel file.
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
By now, you’ve created an empty workbook that we can manipulate.
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Every workbook consists of at least one worksheet. Let’s access the first worksheet.
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
Here, we’re saying, "Give me the first sheet so I can work on it." Simple, right?
## Step 4: Set Fit to Pages Tall
Moving on, you want to control how the worksheet will fit when printed. Start by specifying how many pages tall you want the worksheet to be:
```csharp
worksheet.PageSetup.FitToPagesTall = 1;
```
This means that your entire worksheet content will be scaled down to fit within one printed page in height. 
## Step 5: Set Fit to Pages Wide
Similarly, you can set how many pages wide the worksheet will be:
```csharp
worksheet.PageSetup.FitToPagesWide = 1;
```
Now, your Excel content will fit within one printed page in width as well. 
## Step 6: Save the Workbook
Once you’ve made the changes, it’s time to save your workbook:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "FitToPagesOptions_out.xls");
```
Here, you’re saving your file with the name "FitToPagesOptions_out.xls" in the directory you specified.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully implemented the Fit to Pages options in an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This feature can significantly improve the readability of your spreadsheets, ensuring that no important data gets lost or cut off when printing. Whether you're working on reports, invoices, or any document that you plan on sharing, this nifty tool is one that you’ll appreciate having in your toolkit.
