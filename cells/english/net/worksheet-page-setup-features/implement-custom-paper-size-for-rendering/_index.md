# Implement Custom Paper Size in Worksheet for Rendering

## Introduction
In this article, we're diving into the world of Aspose.Cells for .NET—a powerful library that simplifies Excel file manipulation and rendering. We will walk you through implementing a custom paper size in a worksheet and generating a PDF file with those unique dimensions. This step-by-step tutorial will equip you with everything you need, whether you're a seasoned developer or just beginning your coding journey.
Ready to learn? Let’s jump in!
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, there are a few things you need to have on hand:
1. Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding C# will help you navigate through the code snippets more efficiently.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: Make sure you have the library installed. You can download it directly from [this link](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Visual Studio or Any IDE that Supports C#: You’ll need a compatible development environment to write and test your code.
4. .NET Framework: Ensure you have a suitable .NET framework where Aspose.Cells can operate effectively.
5. Access to Documentation: It's always good to have the [Aspose documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/) handy for reference.
Now that we have the essentials in place, let’s move on to importing the necessary packages.
## Import Packages
To start utilizing Aspose.Cells in your project, you'll need to import the required namespaces. Below is how you can do it in your C# code:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
Make sure these namespaces are included at the top of your file. They will provide the necessary functions and classes for manipulating your workbook.
## Step 1: Set Up the Environment
First and foremost, ensure your development environment is properly configured:
- Open Your IDE: Launch Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE).
- Create a New Project: Start a new project and choose a console or Windows application based on your requirement.
- Add Reference to Aspose.Cells: Go to the project references, and add a reference to the Aspose.Cells DLL that you downloaded. This will enable you to access all the necessary classes and methods.
## Step 2: Create a Workbook Object
In this step, you will create an instance of the Workbook class, which is fundamental for working with Excel files. 
```csharp
// Create workbook object
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
This line initializes a new workbook that we can manipulate later. Think of it as a blank canvas that you’ll fill with your designs.
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Every workbook has one or more worksheets. For this example, we will access the first worksheet and add our customized settings.
```csharp
// Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
Here, we are accessing the first worksheet in our workbook. It’s like choosing the first page of your document to start making edits.
## Step 4: Set Custom Paper Size
Now comes the exciting part! You’ll set your custom paper size in inches. This gives you control over how your content will fit on the page when rendered into a PDF format.
```csharp
// Set custom paper size in unit of inches
ws.PageSetup.CustomPaperSize(6, 4);
```
In this case, we’re defining a paper size of 6 inches in width and 4 inches in height. It’s your chance to create documents that stand out with unique sizing!
## Step 5: Access a Specific Cell
Next, let’s work with a specific cell in our worksheet, where we’ll add some information about the paper size.
```csharp
// Access cell B4
Cell b4 = ws.Cells["B4"];
```
Your document can now be personalized! Here, we’re accessing cell B4, which acts like a little note card in your overall worksheet.
## Step 6: Add Content to the Cell
Now, let’s put a message in our designated cell. This message will inform readers about the dimensions you’ve chosen.
```csharp
// Add the message in cell B4
b4.PutValue("Pdf Page Dimensions: 6.00 x 4.00 in");
```
This line puts a clear indication of the custom paper size in cell B4. You’re essentially labeling your creation—just like signing your artwork!
## Step 7: Save the Workbook as a PDF
Finally, it’s time to save your masterpiece! You’ll save the workbook in PDF format with the custom settings you’ve implemented.
```csharp
// Save the workbook in pdf format
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Specify your output directory
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputCustomPaperSize.pdf");
```
Make sure to specify where you want to save the file. Once executed, this code will generate a PDF with your customized paper size.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You've successfully implemented a custom paper size in a worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. With these simple steps, you can create visually appealing documents tailored to your specific needs, making them more useful and engaging. Remember, the right presentation can elevate your content significantly.
