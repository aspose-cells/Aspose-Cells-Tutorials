# Implement Print Title in Worksheet

## Introduction
When it comes to creating professional reports or spreadsheets, sometimes we need to make certain rows or columns persistently visible, especially when printing. This is where the functionality of print titles shines. Print titles allow you to designate specific rows and columns that will remain visible on every printed page. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, this process becomes a walk in the park! In this tutorial, we’re going to guide you through the steps of implementing print titles in a worksheet. So, roll up your sleeves, and let’s dive right in!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into coding, let’s ensure you have everything set up. Here’s what you’ll need:
1. Visual Studio Installed - You’ll need a working environment for developing applications using .NET.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET - If you haven’t already, download and install Aspose.Cells for .NET. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. .NET Framework - Ensure you are working on a compatible version of the .NET Framework.
4. Basic Knowledge of C# - A little coding background goes a long way, so brush up on your C# skills!
Once you have these prerequisites, you're all set to go!
## Import Packages
To get started, we need to import the necessary packages from the Aspose.Cells library in our C# project. Here’s how you can do that:
## Step 1: Import the Aspose.Cells Namespace
Open your C# file and add the following using directive:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
This step is crucial as it allows you to access all the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Cells, which we will use in the following steps.
Now that we have the imports set up, let’s dig into the step-by-step implementation of print titles.
## Step 2: Set the Document Directory
The first thing we need to do is define where we want to store our document. In our case, we will store our output Excel file. You’ll want to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with a valid path on your machine.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Think of this as setting the stage for a performance. The document directory is the backstage where everything will be prepared before it hits the spotlight!
## Step 3: Instantiate a Workbook Object
Next, we’ll need to create a new Workbook object. This is where all our data will live. Let’s go ahead and do that:
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
Creating a workbook is like laying down the canvas for an artist – we now have a blank sheet to work on!
## Step 4: Access the Page Setup of the Worksheet
To set up the printing options for our workbook, we need to access the PageSetup property of the worksheet. Here’s how we can get that reference:
```csharp
Aspose.Cells.PageSetup pageSetup = workbook.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
```
This step is all about preparing our tools. The PageSetup gives us the options we need to customize our print settings.
## Step 5: Define Title Rows and Columns
It's time to specify which rows and columns we want to make as titles. In our example, we’ll define the first two rows and the first two columns as our titles:
```csharp
pageSetup.PrintTitleColumns = "$A:$B";
pageSetup.PrintTitleRows = "$1:$2";
```
Think of this as tagging your main characters in a story. These rows and columns will be the stars of the show as they will appear on every printed page!
## Step 6: Save the Workbook
Finally, we need to save the modified workbook. Here’s how we do that:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetPrintTitle_out.xls");
```
This step is akin to closing the book after you've written a gripping novel. It ensures all our hard work is saved and ready for printing!
## Conclusion
With just a few simple steps, you can implement print titles in your Excel worksheets using Aspose.Cells for .NET! Now, every time you print your document, those important rows and columns will stay visible, making your data clear and professional. Whether you're working on a complex financial report or a simple data entry spreadsheet, managing the presentation for print is crucial for readability and clarity.
