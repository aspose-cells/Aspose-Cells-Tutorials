# Implement Page Order in Worksheet

## Introduction
Looking to adjust the page order in an Excel worksheet? Sometimes, controlling how data prints is essential, especially with large spreadsheets that don’t fit nicely on one page. Here’s where Aspose.Cells for .NET comes in, providing you with powerful tools to structure your printed pages just the way you like. In this guide, we'll walk you through setting the page order in a worksheet, specifically to print across rows first, then down columns. Sounds technical? Don't worry—I'll keep it simple, breaking everything down step-by-step.
## Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have the following set up:
1. Aspose.Cells for .NET: If you haven’t already, download [Aspose.Cells for .NET here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). Install it in your project to access the features we'll be using.
2. Development Environment: Any .NET-compatible IDE like Visual Studio will work.
3. Basic C# Knowledge: We’ll be working with some C# code, so familiarity with basic programming concepts will be helpful.
Try out [Aspose.Cells for .NET with a free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) or get a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to access all features!
## Import Packages
To begin, we need to import the necessary Aspose.Cells namespaces. This will give us access to everything required for our operations.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
Let’s break down this tutorial into a few straightforward steps. We’ll start by creating a new workbook, access the worksheet’s page setup, set the page order, and then save it. 
## Step 1: Create a Workbook
The first thing we need to do is create a workbook object. This represents our Excel file in Aspose.Cells.
```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
Here, we’re creating an instance of the `Workbook` class. Think of it as opening a new, blank Excel workbook in your program.
## Step 2: Access PageSetup of the Worksheet
To control the print settings, we need to access the `PageSetup` object of the worksheet. This will allow us to adjust how the worksheet is printed or exported.
```csharp
// Obtaining the reference of the PageSetup of the worksheet
PageSetup pageSetup = workbook.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
```
In this line, we’re grabbing the `PageSetup` of the first worksheet (`Worksheets[0]`). This is where we’ll configure our print settings, including the order in which pages print.
## Step 3: Set the Page Order to OverThenDown
Now for the key step: setting the page order. By default, Excel may print down each column before moving to the next row, but here we’re specifying it to go "OverThenDown"—horizontally first, then vertically.
```csharp
// Setting the printing order of the pages to over then down
pageSetup.Order = PrintOrderType.OverThenDown;
```
We’ve set the `Order` property of `PageSetup` to `PrintOrderType.OverThenDown`. This tells Excel to print across rows before moving down to the next row of pages. If you’re printing a wide spreadsheet, this setting ensures everything flows logically on the printout.
## Step 4: Save the Workbook
Finally, let’s save our workbook to see the result. We’ll specify the file path and name where it should be saved.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Save the workbook
workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetPageOrder_out.xls");
```
In the code above, we’re saving the workbook in the specified directory with the name `SetPageOrder_out.xls`. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where you want to save your file.
Need help with output formats? Aspose.Cells supports many, so experiment with formats like `.xlsx` if you need the latest Excel format.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve just set the page order in an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. With just a few lines of code, we controlled how the data prints, which can be a game-changer for presenting large datasets clearly on paper. This is just one of the many print settings you can customize with Aspose.Cells. So, whether you’re preparing reports, print-ready spreadsheets, or organized documents, Aspose.Cells has you covered.
## FAQ's
### Can I change the page order for multiple worksheets at once?
Yes, simply loop through each worksheet in the workbook and apply the same `PageSetup.Order` setting.
### What are the other options for print order besides OverThenDown?
The alternative option is `DownThenOver`, which will print down columns first, then across rows.
### Does this code require a license?
Some features may be limited without a license. You can try [Aspose.Cells for .NET with a free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/).
### Can I preview the page order before printing?
While Aspose.Cells allows print setup, you’ll need to open the saved file in Excel to preview it as there’s no direct preview in Aspose.
### Is this page order setting compatible with other formats like PDF?
Yes, once set, the page order will apply to PDF exports or other supported formats, ensuring consistent page flow.
