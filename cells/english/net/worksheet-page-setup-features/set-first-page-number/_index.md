# Set First Page Number of Worksheet

## Introduction
Setting the first page number in an Excel worksheet can be a game-changer if you're formatting pages for printing or making your document look more professional. In this tutorial, we're going to break down how to set the first page number of a worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you're numbering pages for easy reference or aligning with a larger document, Aspose.Cells provides a powerful yet straightforward way to get it done.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
- Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: You can download the latest version [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
- .NET Development Environment: Visual Studio works well, but any .NET-compatible editor is fine.
- Basic Knowledge of C# and Excel: Familiarity with C# and Excel file handling is helpful.
For any setup guidance, check out the [Aspose.Cells documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/).
## Import Packages
Before starting, import the necessary Aspose.Cells namespace in your C# project to work with the library:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
In this guide, we’ll go through the steps of setting up the first page number of a worksheet in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET.
## Step 1: Define the Directory Path
To make your file saving smooth, start by setting a directory path where your document will be saved. This makes it easier to locate and organize your output files.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Here, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path you want to use. This variable will help in referencing the location to save the final output file.
## Step 2: Initialize the Workbook Object
Now, create a new instance of the `Workbook` class. Think of this as the core container of your Excel file. This object represents the entire workbook, where each sheet, cell, and setting is stored.
```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
By creating a `Workbook`, you're setting the stage for all your Excel-related customizations.
## Step 3: Access the Worksheet
A workbook can contain multiple worksheets. To set the page number on a specific worksheet, access the first one by targeting index `0`. This allows you to configure the sheet within the workbook.
```csharp
// Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
If your workbook contains multiple sheets, you can access each by changing the index. For example, `workbook.Worksheets[1]` would access the second worksheet.
## Step 4: Set the First Page Number
Now comes the core step—setting the first page number. By default, Excel starts page numbering at 1, but you can adjust it to start at any number. This is especially useful if you're continuing a sequence from another document.
```csharp
// Setting the first page number of the worksheet pages
worksheet.PageSetup.FirstPageNumber = 2;
```
In this example, the page number will start from 2 when you print the document. You can set it to any integer that fits your needs.
## Step 5: Save the Workbook
The last step is to save your workbook with the modified settings. Specify the file format and the path so you can review your changes in Excel.
```csharp
// Save the Workbook.
workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetFirstPageNumber_out.xls");
```
Here, `"SetFirstPageNumber_out.xls"` is the name of the output file. You can rename it based on your preference. Once saved, open the file in Excel to see the updated page numbering.
## Conclusion
Setting the first page number of an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET is straightforward, especially when you break it down step by step. With just a few lines of code, you can control page numbering to enhance the professionalism and readability of your document. This feature is invaluable for printed reports, formal presentations, and more.
