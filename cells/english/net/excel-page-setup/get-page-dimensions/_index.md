# Get Page Dimensions

## Introduction

When it comes to handling spreadsheets in .NET applications, the Aspose.Cells library stands out as a robust tool that allows developers to easily manipulate Excel files. But how do you get page dimensions for various paper sizes with this powerful library? In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process step-by-step, ensuring that you not only gain insight into the workings of Aspose.Cells but also become adept at using it in your projects. 

## Prerequisites 

Before we jump into the coding part, there are a few things you’ll need to have in place to follow along effectively:

### Visual Studio
Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. This is where you’ll write and execute your .NET code.

### Aspose.Cells Library
You’ll need to download and reference the Aspose.Cells library in your project. You can get it from:
- Download Link: [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/)

### Basic Knowledge of C#
It would be beneficial if you have a basic understanding of C#. This tutorial will employ fundamental programming concepts that should be easy to follow.

Ready to go? Let’s get started!

## Importing Packages

The first step in our journey is to import the necessary Aspose.Cells packages into our C# project. Here’s how you can do it:

### Create a New Project

Open Visual Studio and create a new C# Console Application project. You can name it whatever you like, let’s go with `GetPageDimensions`.

### Add References

To use Aspose.Cells, you need to add references to the library:
- Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
- Choose “Manage NuGet Packages”.
- Search for “Aspose.Cells” and install it.

### Add Using Directives

At the top of your `Program.cs` file, insert this using directive to access Aspose.Cells functionality:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now that we’ve imported the necessary packages, you’re well on your way! 

Now let’s explore how to retrieve the dimensions of various paper sizes by going through each step. 

## Step 1: Create an Instance of the Workbook Class

The first thing you need to do is create an instance of the Workbook class from Aspose.Cells. This class represents an Excel file.

```csharp
Workbook book = new Workbook();
```

Here, we simply create a new workbook that will hold our spreadsheet data and configurations.

## Step 2: Access the First Worksheet

After creating an instance of the workbook, you'll want to access the first worksheet. Each workbook can contain multiple worksheets, but for this demonstration, we’ll stick to the first one.

```csharp
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets[0];
```

This line fetches the first worksheet, allowing us to set paper sizes and retrieve their respective dimensions.

## Step 3: Setting Paper Size to A2 and Retrieving Dimensions

Now it’s time to set the paper size and grab the dimensions! We begin with A2 paper size.

```csharp
sheet.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperA2;
Console.WriteLine("PaperA2: " + sheet.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + sheet.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```

This code sets the paper size to A2 and immediately outputs the width and height. The beauty of Aspose.Cells is in its simplicity!

## Step 4: Repeat for Other Paper Sizes

You’ll want to repeat this process for other paper sizes like A3, A4, and Letter. Here’s how you can do that:

For A3:

```csharp
sheet.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperA3;
Console.WriteLine("PaperA3: " + sheet.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + sheet.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```

For A4:

```csharp
sheet.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperA4;
Console.WriteLine("PaperA4: " + sheet.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + sheet.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```

For Letter:

```csharp
sheet.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperLetter;
Console.WriteLine("PaperLetter: " + sheet.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + sheet.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```

## Step 5: Conclusion of the Output

Finally, you’ll want to confirm that the entire operation has completed successfully. You can simply log this status to the console:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("GetPageDimensions executed successfully.\r\n");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve now successfully learned how to retrieve page dimensions for different paper sizes using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you’re developing reporting tools, automated spreadsheets, or data analysis functions, being able to pull page dimensions for various formats can be invaluable.
