# Set Excel Page Order

## Introduction

Have you ever found yourself navigating through a jumbled mess of pages in an Excel file? You know what I mean—the printed output doesn’t look the way you envisioned. Well, what if I told you that you can control the order in which your pages are printed? That’s right! With Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can easily set the page order for your Excel workbooks to make them not only look professional but also easy to read. This tutorial will walk you through the steps needed to set Excel page order, ensuring your printed documents present information in a clear and organized manner.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, there are a few things you should have in place:

- .NET Environment: Make sure you have a .NET environment set up on your machine. Whether it's .NET Framework or .NET Core, it should be working smoothly.
- Aspose.Cells Library: You’ll need the Aspose.Cells for .NET library. Don’t worry—it's easy to get started! You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) or get a free trial [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).
- Basic Programming Knowledge: A fundamental understanding of C# programming will help you grasp the concepts better.

## Import Packages

First things first, you have to import the necessary packages in your C# application. Here’s how you do that:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

This line of code allows you to leverage the powerful functionalities offered by Aspose.Cells in your project, giving you the tools needed to manipulate Excel files seamlessly.

Now that we've laid the groundwork, let's break down setting the Excel page order into manageable steps!

## Step 1: Specify Your Document Directory

Before jumping into creating a workbook, you need to specify where to store the output file. This gives you a place to keep tabs on your work. 

You’ll set a variable that points to your document directory like this:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

In this line, replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the path where you want to save your file. For example, if you want to save your file in a folder named "ExcelFiles" on your Desktop, it might look something like this:

```csharp
string dataDir = @"C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\ExcelFiles\";
```

## Step 2: Create a New Workbook


Next, we need to create a new workbook object. This object will serve as your canvas to work with.

Here is how you can create a workbook:

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

This line initializes a new instance of the `Workbook` class, which is the core element for handling Excel files in Aspose.Cells.

## Step 3: Access the Page Setup


Now, we need to access the `PageSetup` property of the worksheet. This will allow you to adjust how the pages are printed.

To access `PageSetup`, use the following code:

```csharp
PageSetup pageSetup = workbook.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
```

Here, `workbook.Worksheets[0]` refers to the first worksheet in your workbook. The `PageSetup` property will give you control over the pagination settings of your sheet.

## Step 4: Set the Printing Order


With the `PageSetup` object, it's time to tell Excel how you want the pages printed. You have the option to set the order as either "Over Then Down" or "Down Then Over."

Here’s the code to set the printing order:

```csharp
pageSetup.Order = PrintOrderType.OverThenDown;
```

In this example, selecting `PrintOrderType.OverThenDown` means that Excel will print the pages starting from the top-down for each column before moving over to the next column. You could also choose `PrintOrderType.DownThenOver` if you prefer a different arrangement.

## Step 5: Save the Workbook


Finally, it’s time to save your work! This step ensures that all your customizations are stored for future use.

You can save the workbook with this code:

```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetPageOrder_out.xls");
```

Ensure you provide a file name, in this case, "SetPageOrder_out.xls", and verify that your `dataDir` variable is correctly pointing to your intended directory.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve just learned how to set the page order in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET. With just a few lines of code, you have the power to customize how your Excel documents are printed, making them easy to follow and visually appealing. This functionality comes in handy, especially when dealing with large datasets where page order can significantly impact readability.
