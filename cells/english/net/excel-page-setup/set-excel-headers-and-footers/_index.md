# Set Excel Headers And Footers

## Introduction

When it comes to managing spreadsheet documents, headers and footers play a crucial role in providing context. Imagine opening an Excel file, and right at the top, you see the name of the worksheet, the date, and maybe even the filename. It gives your document a professional touch and helps communicate important details at a glance. If you’re looking to enhance the professionalism of your Excel sheets using Aspose.Cells for .NET, you’ve landed in the right place! In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to set headers and footers in your Excel spreadsheets effortlessly. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let’s ensure you have everything you need to get started. First off, you’ll need:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. This is where you'll be writing and executing your C# code.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: You need to have the Aspose.Cells library. If you haven't done so already, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. A Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# programming is crucial, as all the code samples will be in this language.
4. A Project Setup: Create a new C# project in Visual Studio where we will implement our Excel header/footer logic.

Once you confirm you have the above prerequisites, it’s time to get our hands dirty!

## Import Packages

To start working with Aspose.Cells, you need to import the appropriate namespaces in your C# code.

### Open Your C# Project

Open your project in Visual Studio where you wish to implement the header and footer settings. Ensure you have a clear structure that can accommodate your code.

### Add Reference to Aspose.Cells

After creating or opening your project, you need to add a reference to the Aspose.Cells library. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, select "Manage NuGet Packages", and search for 'Aspose.Cells'. Install it to your project.

### Import the Namespace

At the top of your C# file, add the following line to import the Aspose.Cells namespace:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

By importing this namespace, you can use the functionalities provided by the Aspose.Cells library without any hindrance.

Great! Now that your environment is set up and your packages are imported, let’s break down the process of setting headers and footers in Excel step by step.

## Step 1: Initialize the Workbook

First, we need to instantiate a Workbook object, which represents our Excel file in memory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Workbook excel = new Workbook();
```

Explanation: Here, replace `YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY` with the actual path where you want to save your Excel file. The `Workbook` object is your main entry point for creating and manipulating Excel files.

## Step 2: Obtain PageSetup Reference

Next, we need to access the `PageSetup` property of the worksheet where we want to set the headers and footers.

```csharp
PageSetup pageSetup = excel.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
```

Explanation: We are accessing the first worksheet (index `0`) of our workbook. The `PageSetup` class provides properties and methods to customize how the page looks when printed, including headers and footers.

## Step 3: Set the Header

Now, let’s start setting up the header. We'll begin with the left section:

```csharp
pageSetup.SetHeader(0, "&A");
```

Explanation: The `SetHeader` method allows us to define the content of the header. Here, `&A` denotes the name of the worksheet, which will appear on the left side of the header.

## Step 4: Customize the Central Header

Next, we’ll customize the central header to display the current date and time in a specific font.

```csharp
pageSetup.SetHeader(1, "&\"Times New Roman,Bold\"&D-&T");
```

Explanation: The `&D` and `&T` codes will automatically replace themselves with the current date and time, respectively. We’re also specifying that the font for this header should be "Times New Roman" and bold.

## Step 5: Set the Right Header

Let’s now set the right section of the header to show the name of the file.

```csharp
pageSetup.SetHeader(2, "&\"Times New Roman,Bold\"&12&F");
```

Explanation: Here, `&F` will be replaced by the file name. We use the same font as we did for the central header to maintain a consistent look.

## Step 6: Configure the Footer

Now that our headers are looking snazzy, let’s turn our attention to the footers. We’ll start with the left footer:

```csharp
pageSetup.SetFooter(0, "Hello World! &\"Courier New\"&14 123");
```

Explanation: We’re inserting a custom message in the left footer, "Hello World!" along with the text `123` in a different font style—Courier New.

## Step 7: Center Footer Configuration

Next, we set the center footer to display the current page number:

```csharp
pageSetup.SetFooter(1, "&P");
```

Explanation: The `&P` code automatically inserts the page number in the center of the footer—a handy way to keep track of pages.

## Step 8: Right Footer Configuration

To finish up our footer settings, let’s set the right footer to show the total number of pages in the document.

```csharp
pageSetup.SetFooter(2, "&N");
```

Explanation: Here, `&N` will be replaced by the total number of pages. It adds a professional touch, especially for longer documents.

## Step 9: Save the Workbook

With everything now set, you just need to save the workbook to see the fruits of your labor.

```csharp
excel.Save(dataDir + "SetHeadersAndFooters_out.xls");
```

Explanation: Replace `"SetHeadersAndFooters_out.xls"` with your desired filename. Save your workbook, and you’re done!
