# Determine If Paper Size Of Worksheet Is Automatic

## Introduction

If you're diving into the world of spreadsheet manipulation using Aspose.Cells for .NET, you've made a fantastic choice. The capability to customize and manage Excel files programmatically can simplify numerous tasks, making your work more efficient. In this guide, we’ll focus on a specific task: determining whether the paper size settings of a worksheet are automatic. So grab your coding hat and let’s get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we leap into the code, let's ensure you have everything you'll need:

### Basic Knowledge of C#
While Aspose.Cells simplifies many tasks, a foundational understanding of C# is crucial. You should be comfortable reading and writing basic C# code.

### Aspose.Cells for .NET
Ensure you have Aspose.Cells installed in your project. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) if you haven’t already.

### Development Environment
You should have an IDE like Visual Studio set up. This guides you through handling and testing your code effectively.

### Sample Excel Files
You’ll need sample files (`samplePageSetupIsAutomaticPaperSize-False.xlsx` and `samplePageSetupIsAutomaticPaperSize-True.xlsx`) for testing purposes. Make sure these files are in your source directory.

## Import Packages

To work with Aspose.Cells in C#, you'll need to import the necessary packages. At the top of your C# file, include:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```

This tells the compiler that you want to use the Aspose.Cells library and the System namespace for basic functionality.

Let’s break it down into a clear, step-by-step tutorial so you can follow along easily. Ready to roll? Here we go!

## Step 1: Set Up Your Source and Output Directories

First things first, you’ll want to define your source and output directories. These directories will hold your input files and where you want to save any output. Here’s how you do it:

```csharp
string sourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY` and `YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` with the actual paths on your system where the files will be stored.

## Step 2: Load the Excel Workbooks

Now that you've set your directories, let’s load the workbooks. We’ll be loading two workbooks—one with automatic paper size set to false and the other with it set to true. Here’s the code:

```csharp
Workbook wb1 = new Workbook(sourceDir + "samplePageSetupIsAutomaticPaperSize-False.xlsx");
Workbook wb2 = new Workbook(sourceDir + "samplePageSetupIsAutomaticPaperSize-True.xlsx");
```

## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet

With the workbooks loaded, it’s time to access the first worksheet from each workbook. The beauty of Aspose.Cells is that this is ridiculously straightforward:

```csharp
Worksheet ws11 = wb1.Worksheets[0];
Worksheet ws12 = wb2.Worksheets[0];
```

This code grabs the first worksheet (index 0) from both workbooks. 

## Step 4: Check the Paper Size Setting

Now comes the fun part! You’ll want to check if the paper size setting is automatic for each worksheet. This is done by inspecting the `IsAutomaticPaperSize` property of the `PageSetup` class. Use the following code snippet:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("First Worksheet of First Workbook - IsAutomaticPaperSize: " + ws11.PageSetup.IsAutomaticPaperSize);
Console.WriteLine("First Worksheet of Second Workbook - IsAutomaticPaperSize: " + ws12.PageSetup.IsAutomaticPaperSize);
```

Here, we’re printing the results to the console. You'll see `True` or `False`, depending on the settings for each worksheet.

## Step 5: Wrap it Up

Finally, it’s a good habit to provide feedback that your code executed successfully. Add a simple message at the end of your main method:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("DetermineIfPaperSizeOfWorksheetIsAutomatic executed successfully.\r\n");
```

## Conclusion 

And just like that, you’ve laid down the groundwork for determining if the paper size of a worksheet is automatic using Aspose.Cells for .NET! You hustled through importing packages, loading workbooks, accessing worksheets, and checking that paper size property—all essential skills when manipulating Excel files programmatically. Remember, the more you experiment with different features of Aspose.Cells, the more powerful your applications will become.
