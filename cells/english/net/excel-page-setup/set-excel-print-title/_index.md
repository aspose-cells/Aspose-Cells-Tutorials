# Set Excel Print Title

## Introduction

When it comes to working with Excel spreadsheets, ensuring clarity in your printed documents is crucial. Ever printed a report only to find that the titles aren’t showing on every page? Frustrating, right? Well, fear no more! In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to set print titles in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET. If you've ever wanted to streamline the printing process to make your spreadsheets look more professional, you've landed in the right place.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the steps, let's ensure you have everything set up to smoothly follow along:

1. Visual Studio Installed: You'll need a working version of Visual Studio on your machine where you can run .NET applications.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: If you haven’t already, download Aspose.Cells for .NET from the [site](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). This library is the heart of our operation for managing Excel files programmatically.
3. Basic Programming Knowledge: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand and modify the code snippets provided.
4. .NET Framework: Make sure you have the correct version of .NET installed for compatibility with Aspose.Cells.

Once you’ve got these prerequisites in place, we can roll up our sleeves and get started!

## Import Packages

To begin harnessing the power of Aspose.Cells, make sure to include the necessary packages in your project. 

### Add Aspose.Cells Reference

To use Aspose.Cells in your program, you’ll need to add a reference to the Aspose.Cells.dll. You can do this by:

- Right-clicking on your project in Solution Explorer.
- Selecting “Add” > “Reference.”
- Navigating to the location of the Aspose.Cells.dll file you downloaded.
- Adding it to your project.

This step is essential, as without it, your code won't recognize Aspose.Cells functions!

### Import Namespace

Now that we have the reference set, let’s import the Aspose.Cells namespace at the top of your C# file. Add the following line:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

This will allow us to use all classes and methods defined in the Aspose.Cells library without fully qualifying them each time.

Alright, now for the fun part—we get to program! In this section, we'll step through a simple example demonstrating how to set print titles for an Excel workbook.

## Step 1: Define Your Document Path

The first thing we need to do is specify where our Excel document will be saved. You can set it to any path on your local system. 

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Just replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the path where you want to save your Excel file. For instance, you could use `@"C:\Reports\"`.

## Step 2: Instantiate a Workbook Object

Next, we create an instance of the `Workbook` class, which represents an Excel file.

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

This line initializes a new workbook, making it ready for manipulation.

## Step 3: Obtain PageSetup Reference

Now let’s access the worksheet’s `PageSetup` property. This is where most of our print settings will be configured.

```csharp
Aspose.Cells.PageSetup pageSetup = workbook.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
```

Here, we're grabbing the `PageSetup` from the first worksheet. This gives us control over how the page is set up for printing.

## Step 4: Define Title Columns

To specify which columns will be printed as titles, we assign column identifiers to our `PrintTitleColumns` property. 

```csharp
pageSetup.PrintTitleColumns = "$A:$B";
```

This example designates columns A and B as title columns. Now, whenever the document is printed, these columns will appear on every page, allowing readers to easily reference the headers.

## Step 5: Define Title Rows

Similarly, you also want to set which rows will appear as titles.

```csharp
pageSetup.PrintTitleRows = "$1:$2";
```

By doing this, rows 1 and 2 are marked as title rows. So, if you’ve got some header information there, it will stay visible across multiple printed pages.

## Step 6: Save the Workbook

The last step of our process is to save the workbook with all the settings we’ve applied. 

```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetPrintTitle_out.xls");
```

Make sure your document directory is specified correctly so you can easily find this newly created Excel file. 

And just like that, your print titles are set, and your Excel file is all set to print!

## Conclusion

Setting print titles in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET is a straightforward process that can drastically improve the readability of your printed documents. By following the steps outlined in this article, you now have the skills to keep those important header rows and columns visible throughout your reports. This not only enhances professional presentation but also saves time during the review process!
