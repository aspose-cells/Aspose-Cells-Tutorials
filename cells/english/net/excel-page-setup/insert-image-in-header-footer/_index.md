# Insert Image In Header Footer

## Introduction

When working with Excel files, headers and footers play a crucial role in providing context and valuable information. Imagine you’re drafting a report for your business, and the company logo needs to be present in the header to give it a professional touch. In this guide, we'll show you how to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to insert an image in the header or footer of your Excel sheets.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the actual code, there are a few things that you need to have ready:

1. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library installed in your .NET environment. If you don’t have it yet, you can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
2. Visual Studio or any other IDE: You'll need an integrated development environment to write and execute your C# code.
3. A Sample Image: Prepare an image that you want to insert in the header or footer. For our example, we will use a company logo called `aspose-logo.jpg`.
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: While not mandatory, understanding C# will make it easier for you to follow along with this tutorial.
5. File System Access: Ensure you have access to your file system where you will read the image and save the Excel file.

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# file. Here’s a quick breakdown:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

These imports will provide access to all the classes we need to manipulate Excel files and handle files on the system.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Directory Path

First, you'll need to specify the directory where your Excel files and images are located. Update the path to fit your local structure.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"; // Update accordingly
```

This line sets the `dataDir` variable, which is the base path for locating the image you want to insert into the header.

## Step 2: Creating a Workbook Object

Next, you need to create a new workbook where you will add your image.

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

This line of code initializes a new instance of the `Workbook` class, allowing you to manipulate Excel spreadsheets.

## Step 3: Defining the Image Path

It’s time to create a string variable to hold the path to the image you want to use. In our case, we are using `aspose-logo.jpg`.

```csharp
string logo_url = dataDir + "aspose-logo.jpg";
```

Here, we concatenate the directory path with the logo file name.

## Step 4: Reading the Image as Binary Data

To insert the image into the header, we need to read the image file as binary data.

```csharp
FileStream inFile = new FileStream(logo_url, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read);
byte[] binaryData = new byte[inFile.Length];
long bytesRead = inFile.Read(binaryData, 0, (int)inFile.Length);
```

- The `FileStream` is used to open the image in read mode.
- Then, we declare a byte array `binaryData` to hold the image data.
- Finally, we read the image data from the `FileStream`.

## Step 5: Accessing the Page Setup Object

To make changes to the header, we must access the `PageSetup` object associated with the first worksheet. 

```csharp
PageSetup pageSetup = workbook.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
```

Here, we get the `PageSetup` object, which allows us to manipulate the printing settings for the worksheet.

## Step 6: Inserting the Image into the Header

With the binary data of the image at hand, we can now insert it into the header.

```csharp
pageSetup.SetHeaderPicture(1, binaryData);
```

This line places the image in the central section of the header. The parameter `1` specifies the header section.

## Step 7: Setting the Header Content

Now that we have our image in place, let’s add some text to the header to enhance its context. 

```csharp
pageSetup.SetHeader(1, "&G"); // Inserts the image
pageSetup.SetHeader(2, "&A"); // Inserts the sheet name
```

- The first line inserts the image placeholder (`&G`).
- The second line adds the sheet name on the right section of the header, using the placeholder (`&A`).

## Step 8: Saving the Workbook

After making all the necessary changes, it's time to save the workbook.

```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "InsertImageInHeaderFooter_out.xls");
```

This line saves the workbook with the specified file name in the directory you defined earlier.

## Step 9: Closing the FileStream

Lastly, don't forget to close your `FileStream` to free up the resources.

```csharp
inFile.Close();
```

This keeps your application tidy and prevents memory leaks.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully added an image to the header of an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether it's a company logo or an inspiring quote, headers can significantly enhance the professionalism of your documents. Now, you can apply this knowledge to various projects—imagine how polished your reports will look with customized headers and footers!
