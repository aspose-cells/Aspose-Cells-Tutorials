# Implement Custom Paper Size Of Worksheet For Rendering

## Introduction

Creating and customizing Excel documents programmatically can make your work more efficient, especially if you deal with numerous reports or data entries. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can easily set custom paper sizes for rendering worksheets. In this tutorial, we'll break down the process into easy-to-follow steps, ensuring you can implement this functionality seamlessly. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just dipping your toes into the world of .NET,

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let’s make sure you’re set up properly. Here’s what you need to get started:

1. Visual Studio or Any .NET IDE: Ensure you have a working IDE like Visual Studio. This will be your playground where all the coding magic happens.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Package: If you haven’t already, you’ll need to download and install the Aspose.Cells library. You can find the latest version on the [Aspose.Cells download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: While we’ll guide you through the code, a familiarity with C# will help you understand the nuances better.
4. Access to .NET Framework: Ensure your project is set up to target a compatible version of the .NET Framework.

## Importing Packages

Once you have everything installed, it's time to import the necessary packages. This is where you bring in Aspose.Cells to your project. Here’s how:

### Open Your IDE

Open Visual Studio or your preferred .NET IDE.

### Create a New Project

Start a new C# Console Application. This is a simple way to test our code without the overhead of a web application.

### Add Aspose.Cells Reference

To add the Aspose.Cells library reference, follow these steps:
- Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer,
- Select "Manage NuGet Packages",
- Search for “Aspose.Cells” and install it.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

Now you’re all set to go!

Now that everything is in place, let’s dig deep into the steps required to implement a custom paper size for your worksheet. 

## Step 1: Set Up the Output Directory

Before we start coding, decide where you want to save your output PDF file, and set it up in your code.

```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

Make sure to replace `"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where you want your PDF document to be saved. Think of this as setting a table before you start cooking; you need a clean space to work on.

## Step 2: Create a Workbook Object

Now, let’s create an instance of the workbook. This is akin to creating a blank canvas to paint on.

```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet

Since a new workbook comes with a default sheet, let’s access that! 

```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

Here, you’re telling your code, “Hey, I want to work with this specific worksheet!” 

## Step 4: Set Custom Paper Size

Now we’re getting to the juicy part. Let’s set the custom paper size for our worksheet.

```csharp
ws.PageSetup.CustomPaperSize(6, 4);
```

In this scenario, we’re specifying the size in inches. Think of it like tailoring a suit to fit perfectly—every detail matters!

## Step 5: Access a Cell

Next, we need to access a specific cell where we’ll place a message. 

```csharp
Cell b4 = ws.Cells["B4"];
```

Here, we’re choosing cell B4. It's like picking a specific spot on your canvas to add some text.

## Step 6: Add a Value to the Cell

Now, let’s add a message into our chosen cell:

```csharp
b4.PutValue("Pdf Page Dimensions: 6.00 x 4.00 in");
```

This is your opportunity to communicate to the end-user what the custom size of the PDF page is.

## Step 7: Save the Workbook in PDF Format

Finally, it’s time to save all your hard work as a PDF file.

```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputCustomPaperSize.pdf");
```

With this line, you are telling your program to take everything you’ve done so far and package it nicely into a PDF format.

## Conclusion

Implementing a custom paper size for your Excel worksheets using Aspose.Cells is not only simple but also incredibly useful. With the steps laid out in this guide, you can create tailored documents that perfectly fit your needs. Whether you’re generating reports or creating custom forms, the ability to customize paper sizes enhances your document’s professionalism and usability.
