# Set Excel First Page Number

## Introduction

When it comes to manipulating Excel files programmatically, Aspose.Cells for .NET stands out as a powerful library. Whether you're developing a web application that generates reports or building a desktop application that manages data, having control over Excel file formatting is crucial. One of the often-overlooked features is setting the first page number of your Excel worksheets. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to do just that with a step-by-step approach.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the juicy stuff, let's make sure you have everything you need to get started. Here’s a short checklist:

1. .NET Environment: Ensure you have a .NET development environment set up. You can use Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: You'll need the Aspose.Cells library, which can be easily installed via NuGet. You can download it directly from the [Aspose.Cells website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) if you prefer.
3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with the C# programming language will go a long way in helping you understand the examples provided.

## Importing Packages

Once you have the prerequisites out of the way, let's import the necessary packages. In this case, we are primarily focusing on the `Aspose.Cells` namespace. Here’s how you get started:

### Create a New Project

Open your IDE and create a new C# project. You can choose a Console Application for simplicity.

### Install Aspose.Cells

To install Aspose.Cells, open your NuGet Package Manager and search for `Aspose.Cells`, or use the Package Manager Console with the following command:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

### Import the Namespace

Now that you have the library installed, you need to include it in your project. Add this line at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

At this point, you’re all set to start manipulating Excel files!

With your project set up, let's go through the process of setting the first page number for the first worksheet in an Excel file.

## Step 1: Define the Data Directory

First, we need to define where our documents will be stored. This path will be used to save our modified Excel file.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your actual path
```

Make sure to customize the `dataDir` variable with your actual file path where you want the output Excel file to be saved.

## Step 2: Create a Workbook Object

Next, we need to create an instance of the Workbook class. This class represents the Excel file we are going to work with.

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

So, what's a Workbook? Think of it as a virtual suitcase that holds all your worksheets and settings.

## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet

Now that we have our workbook, we need to get a reference to the first worksheet. In Aspose.Cells, worksheets are zero-indexed, meaning the first worksheet is at index 0.

```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 4: Set the First Page Number

Now, here comes the magic! You can set the first page number of the worksheet’s printed pages by assigning a value to `FirstPageNumber`:

```csharp
worksheet.PageSetup.FirstPageNumber = 2;
```

In this case, we’re setting the first page number to 2. So when you print the document, the first page will be numbered 2 instead of the default 1. This is particularly useful for reports that should continue a page numbering from previous documents.

## Step 5: Save the Workbook

Finally, it’s time to save your changes. The `Save` method will save the workbook to the specified location.

```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetFirstPageNumber_out.xls");
```

Make sure the filename ends with an appropriate extension, such as `.xls` or `.xlsx`.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You've successfully set the first page number of an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This tiny feature can make a huge difference, especially in professional or academic environments where document presentation matters.
