## Implementation Guide

### Reading an Excel Workbook
**Overview:** This feature demonstrates how to load an Excel file and access its worksheets.

#### Step 1: Load the Workbook
```csharp
string sourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleReadingAndWritingQueryTable.xlsx");
```

#### Step 2: Access Worksheets
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

### Accessing Query Table in a Worksheet
**Overview:** Learn how to access specific Query Tables within an Excel worksheet.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Workbook and Worksheet
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleReadingAndWritingQueryTable.xlsx");
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

#### Step 2: Access the Query Table
```csharp
QueryTable qt = worksheet.QueryTables[0];
```

### Reading Query Table Properties
**Overview:** This feature demonstrates reading properties like `AdjustColumnWidth` and `PreserveFormatting`.

```csharp
bool adjustColumnWidth = qt.AdjustColumnWidth;
bool preserveFormatting = qt.PreserveFormatting;

// Explanation: AdjustColumnWidth auto-sizes columns, PreserveFormatting maintains the original format.
```

### Modifying Query Table Properties
