# Format Comments -  Font, Color, Alignment

## Introduction
If you've ever felt that your Excel sheets could use a little more flair or a helpful guiding hand, you're definitely not alone. Comments in Excel can be superb tools for collaboration, providing context and clarifications to your spreadsheets without cluttering the view. If you want to jazz up your Excel comments by customizing their font, color, and alignment using Aspose.Cells for .NET, you’re in the right place! This tutorial is brimming with practical insights that will take you from “What do I do?” to being the proud creator of stylish, informative Excel comments.
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of formatting your comments, there are a few things you’ll need:
1. Environment Setup: Make sure you have a .NET development environment installed, preferably Visual Studio.
2. Aspose.Cells: Download and install Aspose.Cells from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). This library will enable you to interact with Excel files effortlessly.
3. Basic C# Knowledge: While we will guide you through the code, a fundamental understanding of C# will help you tweak things as necessary.
4. Aspose License: If you plan to use Aspose.Cells for extended sessions or in production, consider purchasing a license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) or use a temporary license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
## Import Packages
To start using Aspose.Cells, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Here’s how you can do it:
### Create a New Project
- Open Visual Studio and create a new project.
- Choose Console App as your project type, and name it anything suitable—like `ExcelCommentsDemo`.
### Add Aspose.Cells Library
- Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
- Select Manage NuGet Packages.
- Search for `Aspose.Cells`, and install the latest version.
### Import Required Namespaces
Open your main C# file and add the following lines at the top:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
This brings all the functionality of Aspose.Cells into your workspace.
Now that we have our environment set, let’s dive into creating and formatting comments in an Excel sheet.
## Step 1: Setting the Document Directory
Before you start creating your workbook, you need to define where your files will reside. Here’s how to do it:
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
In this snippet, we define a path for saving our Excel file. If that directory doesn’t exist, we create it! 
## Step 2: Instantiating a Workbook Object
Next, you’ll want to create a Workbook object, which is essentially your Excel file in memory.
```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
This line initializes a new workbook where you can add sheets, modify data, and, of course, add comments.
## Step 3: Adding a New Worksheet
Every Excel workbook can contain multiple sheets. Let’s add one:
```csharp
// Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
int sheetIndex = workbook.Worksheets.Add();
```
With this, you add a new sheet and capture its index for later use.
## Step 4: Accessing the Newly Added Worksheet
Now that we have a sheet, let’s get a reference to it:
```csharp
// Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[sheetIndex];
```
This gives you a handle on the worksheet, allowing you to perform various operations.
## Step 5: Adding a Comment to a Cell
Here’s where the fun begins! Let’s slap a comment on cell F5:
```csharp
// Adding a comment to "F5" cell
int commentIndex = worksheet.Comments.Add("F5");
```
We specify the cell's position, and the comment is added that we can further customize.
## Step 6: Accessing the Added Comment
Now, we want to work with that comment. Here’s how to access it:
```csharp
// Accessing the newly added comment
Comment comment = worksheet.Comments[commentIndex];
```
Now that we have our comment, we can modify it as we wish.
## Step 7: Setting the Comment Text
Let’s fill that comment with some useful text:
```csharp
// Setting the comment note
comment.Note = "Hello Aspose!";
```
This is the part that displays the note when you hover over cell F5. 
## Step 8: Customizing the Comment’s Font Size
Want your comments to stand out? You can adjust the font size with ease:
```csharp
// Setting the font size of a comment to 14
comment.Font.Size = 14;
```
A bold extension will definitely draw attention!
## Step 9: Bolding the Font
Want to go a step further? Make your comments bold:
```csharp
// Setting the font of a comment to bold
comment.Font.IsBold = true;
```
This little trick will make your notes impossible to miss!
## Step 10: Setting the Height and Width
Feeling creative? You can change the height and width of your comment as well:
```csharp
// Setting the height of the font to 10
comment.HeightCM = 10;
// Setting the width of the font to 2
comment.WidthCM = 2;
```
This customization keeps your comments neat and makes them more visually appealing.
## Step 11: Saving Your Workbook
Finally, don’t forget to save your masterpiece:
```csharp
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls");
```
And there you go! You’ve just created and styled an Excel comment, making it pop right off the screen!
