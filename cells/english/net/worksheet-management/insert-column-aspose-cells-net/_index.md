### Overview
Programmatically adding columns allows seamless data management and reporting. We'll cover how to open an existing Excel file, insert a column at a specified position, and save the changes.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Set Up Your Environment
Create a new C# project in Visual Studio and install Aspose.Cells using the steps mentioned above.

#### 2. Write the Code to Insert a Column
Here’s how you can insert a column into an Excel file:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;

namespace Aspose.Cells.Examples.CSharp.RowsColumns.InsertingAndDeleting
{
    public class InsertingAColumn
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Define the path to your documents directory.
            string dataDir = "YourPathHere\\";
            
            // Open an existing Excel file using a file stream
            FileStream fstream = new FileStream(dataDir + "book1.xls", FileMode.Open);
            
            // Create a Workbook object and open the Excel file through the file stream
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
            
            // Access the first worksheet in the workbook
            Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
            
            // Insert a column at the second position (index 1)
            worksheet.Cells.InsertColumn(1);
            
            // Save the modified Excel file
            workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xls");
            
            // Close the file stream to release resources
            fstream.Close();
        }
    }
}
```
**Explanation of Key Steps:**
- **FileStream**: Used for opening an existing file.
- **Workbook**: Represents the entire Excel document.
