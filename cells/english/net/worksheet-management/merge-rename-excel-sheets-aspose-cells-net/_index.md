## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Merge Multiple Excel Files

This feature demonstrates how to combine several .xls files into a single output using Aspose.Cells.

#### Step 1: Define Source and Output Directories

Set the paths for your source and destination directories:

```csharp
string YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Specify Files to Merge

Create an array of file paths that you want to merge:

```csharp
String[] files = new String[2];
files[0] = YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY + "/sampleMergeFiles_Book1.xls";
files[1] = YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY + "/sampleMergeFiles_Book2.xls";
```

#### Step 3: Execute the Merge

Use `CellsHelper.MergeFiles` to merge your Excel files into a single workbook:

```csharp
string cacheFile = YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "/cacheMergeFiles.txt";
string dest = YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "/outputMergeFiles.xls";

CellsHelper.MergeFiles(files, cacheFile, dest);
```

### Feature 2: Rename Sheets in Merged Excel File

After merging the files, you might want to rename each sheet for better organization.

#### Step 1: Load the Workbook

Load the workbook where sheets will be renamed:

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "/outputMergeFiles.xls");
```

#### Step 2: Rename Sheets Sequentially

Iterate through each worksheet and assign a new name:

```csharp
int i = 1;
foreach (Worksheet sheet in workbook.Worksheets)
{
    sheet.Name = "Sheet" + i++;
}
```

#### Step 3: Save the Workbook

Finally, save your changes to preserve the renamed sheets:

```csharp
workbook.Save(YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "/outputMergeFiles.xls");
```

## Practical Applications
