# Number and Display Formats in Excel

## Introduction

When we think about Excel, we often envision spreadsheets filled with data. But have you ever tried to make that data visually appealing or easier to digest? That's where number formats come into play. Using Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can automate the formatting process, which can save you a ton of time, especially when dealing with large datasets. Let’s dive into how you can utilize these formats programmatically, focusing on two key areas: built-in number formats and custom display formats.

## Using Built-In Number Formats

Getting started with built-in number formats is incredibly straightforward! Suppose you want your Excel sheet to show monetary values consistently. Instead of manually formatting each cell, you can use Aspose.Cells to apply formats like currency or percentage automatically. This functionality not only enhances the presentation but also eliminates human error. Imagine the relief of knowing that all your data is correctly formatted before sending it out. It’s like having a personal assistant dedicated just to your spreadsheet's aesthetics! For more on this, check out our tutorial on [Using Built-In Number Formats in Excel Programmatically](./using-built-in-number-formats/).

## Customizing Display Formats

If you’re looking to add a personal touch to your Excel sheets, customizing display formats is the way to go. This feature lets you create user-defined number formats to match your specific requirements. You might be wondering how this works—think of it this way: just like a painter chooses the right colors for their masterpiece, you get to choose how your data is presented. Whether it’s a unique date format or a specialized way to display percentages, Aspose.Cells empowers you to make those choices easily. To learn how to harness this power, don’t miss our detailed guide on [Customizing Display Formats with User-Defined Numbers](./customizing-display-formats-with-user-defined-numbers/).
