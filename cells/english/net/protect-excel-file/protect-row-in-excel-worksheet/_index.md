# Protect Row In Excel Worksheet

## Introduction

When working with Excel sheets, it’s often necessary to protect specific rows to maintain the integrity of data. Whether you are managing a team project, overseeing a financial report, or sharing documentation, restricting access to certain rows can prevent unwanted changes. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to leverage Aspose.Cells for .NET to protect specific rows in an Excel worksheet. So, grab your coding hat, and let’s dive into the exciting world of Excel manipulation with C#!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the hands-on part, let’s make sure you have everything set up. Here are some prerequisites:

1. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download the library from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). Ensure you have the latest version for all the new features and bug fixes.
2. Visual Studio: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio (Community, Professional, or Enterprise) will help you compile and run your C# code effectively.
3. .NET Framework: You'll need a compatible version of the .NET Framework. Aspose.Cells supports multiple versions, so ensure yours is up to date. 
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: A foundational understanding of C# will be beneficial as we write our code throughout this guide.
5. Reference Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the [Aspose.Cells for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/) for additional details on methods and classes used.

## Import Packages

The first step in our journey is to import the necessary packages in our C# project. Aspose.Cells operates through a set of classes that we need to include:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```

Now that we've imported the required packages, let’s walk through the steps to create an Excel workbook and protect a specific row. 

## Step 1: Define the Directory

In this step, we will specify the location where our Excel file will be saved. It is important to ensure that this directory exists, or else we will create it programmatically if needed.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your document path
bool IsExists = Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
}
```
In this code, replace `YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY` with the actual path where you’d like to save your Excel file.

## Step 2: Create a New Workbook

Next, we will create a new workbook where all the manipulation will occur. This is a fundamental step, like laying down the foundation before building your dream house.

```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
This line initializes a new instance of the `Workbook` class, creating a fresh worksheet for us to work on.

## Step 3: Access the Worksheet

With the workbook created, let’s get our hands on the first worksheet. Remember, an Excel file can contain multiple sheets, so choosing the right one is crucial.

```csharp
Worksheet sheet = wb.Worksheets[0]; // Accessing the first sheet
```

## Step 4: Unlock All Columns

Before locking a specific row, it’s a good practice to unlock all columns initially. This allows us to control which data remains editable later on.

```csharp
Style style;
StyleFlag flag;

// Loop through all columns and unlock them
for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i++)
{
    style = sheet.Cells.Columns[(byte)i].Style;
    style.IsLocked = false;
    flag = new StyleFlag();
    flag.Locked = true;
    sheet.Cells.Columns[(byte)i].ApplyStyle(style, flag);
}
```
This loop iterates through the first 256 columns, unlocking each one to ensure default editing permissions.

## Step 5: Locking the Specific Row

Now, we will target the first row of our worksheet for locking. This step ensures that users cannot make unauthorized changes to the critical data contained in this row.

```csharp
style = sheet.Cells.Rows[0].Style; // Get the style of the first row
style.IsLocked = true; // Lock the row
flag = new StyleFlag();
flag.Locked = true; // Set the lock flag
sheet.Cells.ApplyRowStyle(0, style, flag); // Apply the style to the first row
```
Here, we retrieve the style for the first row, mark it as locked, and apply the locking style. This is analogous to putting a lock on an important drawer—essential to securing sensitive information!

## Step 6: Protecting the Sheet

With our row locked, let’s take that extra step and fully protect the worksheet. This will enforce the lock across all functionalities defined in the `ProtectionType`.

```csharp
sheet.Protect(ProtectionType.All); // Protect the sheet with all features
```
By applying this protection, users can’t edit the locked row or make any changes that could affect the locked areas.

## Step 7: Saving the Workbook

The final step involves saving the workbook. This is where all our hard work pays off, and we can see our beautiful, protected spreadsheet come to life!

```csharp
wb.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
```
Make sure the saved file name and format match your requirements. In this case, we’re saving it as an older Excel format (Excel 97-2003).

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve successfully learned how to protect a specific row in an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. With just a few lines of code, not only did you create a workbook, but you also managed to secure sensitive information, ensuring that your Excel files remain intact and trustworthy. Whether it’s a financial report, attendance sheet, or a collaborative project plan, protecting crucial data is essential.
