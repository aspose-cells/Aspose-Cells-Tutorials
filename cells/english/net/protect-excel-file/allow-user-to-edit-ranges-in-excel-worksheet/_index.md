# Allow User To Edit Ranges In Excel Worksheet

## Introduction

When it comes to working with Excel worksheets, flexibility is often key—especially when multiple users need access to edit specific areas without compromising the data integrity of the entire sheet. This is where Aspose.Cells for .NET shines! In this tutorial, we’re going to dive into how to allow users to edit certain ranges within an Excel worksheet while protecting the rest of the document. By the end of this article, you’ll not only grasp the concepts but also have a tangible example to work with. 

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, let’s ensure you have everything you need to get started:

1. .NET Development Environment: You should have a functioning .NET development environment set up (this could be Visual Studio or any other IDE of your choice).
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: Download and install the Aspose.Cells library. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you navigate through the code examples easily.
4. Understanding Excel Basics: Knowing how Excel works will provide a foundation for the functionalities we’ll be discussing.

Once these prerequisites are sorted, you’re ready to go!

## Import Packages

Before we start coding, we need to ensure that our project recognizes the Aspose.Cells namespace. Here’s how to import the necessary packages:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```

Now that we’ve imported what we need, let’s dive into our tutorial step by step.

## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory

For any file operations, it’s crucial to have a defined location where our documents will be saved. Let’s set up our working directory to store the Excel files.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```

First, replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the path where you want your files to be saved. This code checks if the directory exists; if it doesn't, it creates one.

## Step 2: Instantiate a New Workbook

With our working directory ready, it’s time to create our Excel workbook. 

```csharp
// Instantiate a new Workbook
Workbook book = new Workbook();
```

Here, we’re creating a new instance of the `Workbook` class provided by Aspose.Cells, which allows us to manipulate the Excel file.

## Step 3: Access the Default Worksheet

Every newly created workbook comes with at least one worksheet. Let’s access that.

```csharp
// Get the first (default) worksheet
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets[0];
```

In this code snippet, we access the first worksheet of our workbook, which we'll manipulate in subsequent steps.

## Step 4: Get Allow Edit Ranges

To enable specific ranges of the worksheet for editing, we need to access the `AllowEditRanges` property.

```csharp
// Get the Allow Edit Ranges
ProtectedRangeCollection allowRanges = sheet.AllowEditRanges;
```

This collection will allow us to manage which ranges are editable in our worksheet.

## Step 5: Define the Protected Range

Next, let’s define which part of the worksheet we want to protect while allowing edits to a specified range.

```csharp
// Define ProtectedRange
ProtectedRange proteced_range;

// Create the range
int idx = allowRanges.Add("r2", 1, 1, 3, 3);
proteced_range = allowRanges[idx];

// Specify the password
proteced_range.Password = "123";
```

In this step, we’re adding a new editable range called "r2" that allows edits in the cells from row 1 column 1 to row 3 column 3. Additionally, we are setting a password to protect this range, ensuring only authorized users can modify it.

## Step 6: Protect the Worksheet

Now that we’ve set up our editable range, we need to protect the worksheet.

```csharp
// Protect the sheet
sheet.Protect(ProtectionType.All);
```

This code will protect the entirety of the worksheet from any unwanted changes, except for the range we just specified.

## Step 7: Save the Excel File

Let’s save the workbook so we can see our changes reflected in an Excel file.

```csharp
// Save the Excel file
book.Save(dataDir + "protectedrange.out.xls");
```

Make sure to adjust the filename as needed. This will create an Excel file in your specified directory with the settings we’ve configured.

## Conclusion

There you have it! You’ve successfully created an Excel worksheet that restricts edits to a designated range while protecting the rest of the sheet. Using Aspose.Cells for .NET makes managing these kinds of tasks much more straightforward and efficient. Whether you’re developing a complex application or just need to manage data securely, these capabilities can enhance your workflow significantly.
