### Load Workbook
**Overview:**
Loading an Excel workbook is your first step to manipulating its content with Aspose.Cells.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Initialize Workbook Instance**
   Use the `Workbook` class to load an existing file.
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Cells;

   string sourceDir = @"YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
   Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "/sampleInsertDeleteRows.xlsx");
   ```
   - The constructor of the `Workbook` class takes a path to your Excel file.

### Insert Rows
**Overview:**
Adding rows is crucial for appending information or adjusting datasets.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Load Workbook and Access Worksheet**
   ```csharp
   string sourceDir = @"YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
   string outputDir = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

   Workbook workbookInsert = new Workbook(sourceDir + "/sampleInsertDeleteRows.xlsx");
   Worksheet sheetInsert = workbookInsert.Worksheets[0];
   ```
2. **Insert Rows**
   Use the `InsertRows` method.
   ```csharp
   // Insert 10 rows starting from row index 2.
   sheetInsert.Cells.InsertRows(2, 10);
   ```
3. **Save Changes**
   Save your workbook with modifications.
   ```csharp
   workbookInsert.Save(outputDir + "/outputInsertRows.xlsx");
   ```

### Delete Rows
**Overview:**
Removing unnecessary rows helps streamline data and improve readability.

#### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Load Workbook and Access Worksheet**

   Workbook workbookDelete = new Workbook(sourceDir + "/sampleInsertDeleteRows.xlsx");
   Worksheet sheetDelete = workbookDelete.Worksheets[0];
   ```
2. **Delete Rows**
   Use the `DeleteRows` method.
   ```csharp
   // Delete 5 rows starting at row index 17.
   sheetDelete.Cells.DeleteRows(17, 5);
   ```
3. **Save Changes**
   Save your workbook with deletions applied.
