# Access OLE Object Label in Excel

## Introduction
If you've ever dabbled in Excel, you know how powerful and intricate it can be. Sometimes, you might stumble upon data embedded in OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects—think of it as a 'mini-window' to another software tool, like a Word document or a PowerPoint slide, all nestled comfortably within your spreadsheet. But how do we access and manipulate these labels within our OLE objects using Aspose.Cells for .NET? Buckle up, because in this tutorial, we’re breaking it down step by step!
## Prerequisites
 
Before we jump into the action-packed world of Aspose.Cells for .NET, here’s what you need to have in your toolkit:
1. Visual Studio Installed: This will be your playground where you’ll be coding and testing your C# application.
2. .NET Framework: Ensure you're working with at least .NET Framework 4.0 or higher. This will give our program the necessary foundation to work smoothly.
3. Aspose.Cells Library: You’ll need a copy of the Aspose.Cells library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). If you want to try it before making a purchase, check out the [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/).
4. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# will help you breeze through the code.
With that out of the way, let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of accessing and modifying labels on OLE objects!
## Import Packages 
To start, we need to import the necessary packages into our project. This will make our lives easier by giving us access to all the functions and classes we need. Here’s how:
### Create a New C# Project 
- Open Visual Studio and create a new C# Console Application project.
- Name it something like "OLEObjectLabelExample".
### Add the Aspose.Cells Reference 
- Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
- Select "Manage NuGet Packages".
- Search for "Aspose.Cells" and install the library.
### Import Namespaces
At the top of your program file (e.g., `Program.cs`), you need to import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.IO;
```
These namespaces will help us access classes and methods needed for our Excel manipulations.
Now that everything is in place, let’s access and modify the label of an OLE object embedded in an Excel file. Follow the step-by-step guide below:
## Step 1: Set the Source Directory
First, we define the directory where your Excel document is located. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with your actual document path.
```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load the Sample Excel File 
Next, we’ll load the .xlsx Excel file that contains our OLE object:
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleAccessAndModifyLabelOfOleObject.xlsx");
```
This line initializes a `Workbook` object that gives us access to all the worksheets and components of the Excel file.
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Now, let’s access the first worksheet in our workbook:
```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
Here, `Worksheets[0]` is the first worksheet in the collection.
## Step 4: Access the First OLE Object 
Next, we’ll retrieve the first OLE object:
```csharp
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.OleObject oleObject = ws.OleObjects[0];
```
This will allow us to interact with the OLE object we want to work with.
## Step 5: Display the Label of the OLE Object
Before we modify the label, let’s print out its current value:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Ole Object Label - Before: " + oleObject.Label);
```
This gives us a clear view of the label before any changes are made.
## Step 6: Modify the Label 
Now for the fun part—let’s change the label of the OLE object:
```csharp
oleObject.Label = "Aspose APIs";
```
You can set this to whatever you like. “Aspose APIs” is just a neat way to show what we're doing.
## Step 7: Save Workbook to Memory Stream 
We’ll then save our changes to a memory stream before reloading the workbook:
```csharp
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
wb.Save(ms, SaveFormat.Xlsx);
```
This saves our modified workbook in-memory, making it easy to access later.
## Step 8: Set the Workbook Reference to Null 
To clear up memory, we should set the workbook reference to null:
```csharp
wb = null;
```
## Step 9: Load Workbook from Memory Stream 
Next, we’ll reload our workbook from the memory stream we just saved:
```csharp
wb = new Workbook(ms);
```
## Step 10: Access the First Worksheet Again 
Just like before, we need to access the first worksheet again:
```csharp
ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
## Step 11: Access the First OLE Object Again
Now, retrieve the OLE object again for the final check:
```csharp
oleObject = ws.OleObjects[0];
```
## Step 12: Display the Modified Label 
To see if our changes took effect, let’s print out the new label:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Ole Object Label - After: " + oleObject.Label);
```
## Step 13: Confirm Execution 
Finally, give a success message so we know everything went as planned:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("AccessAndModifyLabelOfOleObject executed successfully.");
```
## Conclusion 
And there you have it! You've successfully accessed and modified the label of an OLE object within Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET. It’s a great way to add a personal touch to your embedded documents, enhancing clarity and communication within your spreadsheets. 
Whether you’re developing a cool application or just sprucing up your reports, manipulating OLE objects can be a game-changer. Keep exploring what Aspose.Cells offers, and you'll discover an entire world of possibilities.
