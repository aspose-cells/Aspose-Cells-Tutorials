# Determine if Shape is Smart Art in Excel

## Introduction
Have you ever found yourself struggling to identify whether a particular shape in your Excel sheet is a Smart Art graphic? If yes, then you’re not alone! Smart Art can really jazz up an Excel sheet, providing both visual appeal and efficient data presentation. However, recognizing these graphics through programming can be confusing. That's where Aspose.Cells for .NET steps in, allowing you to easily check if a shape is Smart Art. 
In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the steps required to determine if a shape is Smart Art in an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for .NET. By the end of this guide, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to streamline your Excel tasks with this powerful library.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the technical details, let’s cover what you should have in place to follow along with this tutorial:
1. Visual Studio: This is where we’ll be writing our code. Make sure you have a version compatible with .NET Framework or .NET Core.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You need to have this library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Programming Knowledge: Familiarity with C# and an understanding of concepts like classes and methods will make this process smoother.
4. Sample Excel File: You’ll also need a sample Excel file containing shapes and Smart Art for testing.
With these prerequisites checked off, you’re ready to jump into the code!
## Import Packages
Before we can start writing code, we need to import the necessary packages. This is crucial to ensure that we have access to the relevant classes and methods provided by Aspose.Cells.
### Create a New Project
1. Open Visual Studio:
   Start by launching Visual Studio on your computer.
2. Create a New Project:
   Click on ‘Create a new project’, selecting the type that’s appropriate for your needs (such as a Console Application).
### Add Aspose.Cells to Your Project
To use Aspose.Cells, you need to add it to your project. Here's how:
1. NuGet Package Manager:
   - Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer.
   - Select `Manage NuGet Packages`.
   - Search for "Aspose.Cells" and install the package.
2. Verify Installation:
   Go to the Project References to ensure Aspose.Cells appears in the list. 
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
```
Now that we have our environment set up and dependencies added, let's start coding! Below, we will break down the code snippet provided, explaining each step along the way.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Source Directory
First things first, you’ll want to specify the location of your Excel file.
```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where your `sampleSmartArtShape.xlsx` file is located. This is where the application will look for the Excel file that contains the shapes you’d like to inspect.
## Step 2: Load the Excel Workbook
Next, we’ll load the Excel file into the Aspose.Cells `Workbook` class.
```csharp
// Load the sample smart art shape - Excel file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleSmartArtShape.xlsx");
```
The `Workbook` class is essentially a representation of your Excel file in code. Here, we’re creating an instance of `Workbook` and passing the path to our Excel file so that it can be processed.
## Step 3: Access the Worksheet
After loading the workbook, we’ll need to access the specific worksheet containing the shape.
```csharp
// Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
Excel files can contain multiple worksheets. By indexing with `[0]`, we are accessing the first worksheet in our workbook. 
## Step 4: Access the Shape
Now we will retrieve the specific shape that we want to check.
```csharp
// Access first shape
Shape sh = ws.Shapes[0];
```
Just like worksheets, worksheets can have multiple shapes. Here, we are accessing the first shape within our worksheet. 
## Step 5: Determine If the Shape is Smart Art
Finally, we’ll implement the core functionality—checking if the shape is a Smart Art graphic.
```csharp
// Determine if shape is smart art
Console.WriteLine("Is Smart Art Shape: " + sh.IsSmartArt);
```
The `IsSmartArt` property of the `Shape` class returns a boolean indicating whether the shape is classified as Smart Art. We use `Console.WriteLine` to output this information. 
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you learned how to determine if a shape in an Excel worksheet is a Smart Art graphic using Aspose.Cells for .NET. With this knowledge, you can enhance your data presentation and streamline your workflow. Whether you’re a seasoned Excel user or a novice, integrating smart features like this can make a world of difference.
