# Extract Embedded Mol File

## Introduction

Have you ever found yourself needing to extract embedded files, specifically MOL files, from an Excel spreadsheet? It’s a tricky job, isn’t it? But don’t worry! With the help of Aspose.Cells for .NET, we can turn this seemingly complicated task into a walk in the park. In this tutorial, we'll guide you step-by-step on how to extract MOL files from an Excel file using the powerful Aspose.Cells library.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the extraction process, let’s make sure you're fully equipped to follow along. Here’s what you need:

- Basic Knowledge of C#: A little familiarity with C# will go a long way. Even if you're just starting out, you should be able to keep pace.
- Visual Studio: Have Visual Studio installed on your system. It’s necessary for writing and executing your C# code.
- Aspose.Cells for .NET: If you haven't downloaded it yet, head over to the [Aspose.Cells download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) and grab the latest version.
- .NET Framework: Ensure that you have a compatible version of the .NET Framework installed.
- An Excel File with Embedded MOL Objects: For our example, we’ll be using `EmbeddedMolSample.xlsx`. Make sure you have this file ready for the extraction.

## Import Packages

Now that we have everything we need, it’s time to set up our project. Here's how to import the necessary packages in your C# project:

### Create a New Project

Open Visual Studio and choose to create a new C# Console Application.

### Add NuGet Package for Aspose.Cells

In your newly created project, you’ll need to add the Aspose.Cells package. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager:

1. Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for "Aspose.Cells" and click "Install."

### Import the Aspose.Cells Namespace

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using Aspose.Cells.WebExtensions;
using System;
using System.IO;
```

Your project should now be able to utilize the functionalities of the Aspose.Cells library.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Now that you've imported the required packages, let’s set up our environment to extract the MOL files.

```csharp
//directories
string SourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";

```

This initializes the workbook using the Excel file that contains your embedded MOL files.


Let's break down the extraction process into easy-to-follow steps.

## Step 2: Load the Workbook

Once you have your `workbook` set up with our sample Excel file, the next step is to load the workbook and prepare for the extraction:

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDir + "EmbeddedMolSample.xlsx");
```

In this step, we create a new instance of the `Workbook` class, which acts as a bridge to the content of your Excel file. The file is loaded here so we can later iterate through the sheets and find the embedded MOL objects.

## Step 3: Iterate Through Worksheets

Now that our workbook is loaded, it’s time to dig deeper. You need to loop through each worksheet in the workbook to find any embedded objects:

```csharp
foreach (Worksheet sheet in workbook.Worksheets)
{
    OleObjectCollection oles = sheet.OleObjects;
    // Continue processing OLE objects...
}
```

With this snippet, we’re using a `foreach` loop to go through every sheet in our workbook. By accessing the `OleObjects` collection, we can get access to all embedded objects on that particular sheet. 

## Step 4: Extract OLE Objects

Here's where the magic happens! You need to loop through each OLE object to extract and save the MOL files:

```csharp
var index = 1;
foreach (OleObject ole in oles)
{
    string fileName = outputDir + "OleObject" + index + ".mol";
    FileStream fs = File.Create(fileName);
    fs.Write(ole.ObjectData, 0, ole.ObjectData.Length);
    fs.Close();
    index++;
}
```

In this approach:
- We keep track of the index to name the output files sequentially.
- For each OLE object, we create a new file using FileStream.
- We then write the embedded data into this file and close the stream.

## Step 5: Confirm Execution

After your extraction logic is done, it's a good practice to confirm the successful execution of your extraction process:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("ExtractEmbeddedMolFile executed successfully.");
```

This simple line outputs a message to the console when your entire extraction operation completes seamlessly. 

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve successfully extracted embedded MOL files from an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Now you can take your newfound skills and apply them to other scenarios where you need to extract object files from Excel sheets. This method is not only effective but also opens doors to handling various Excel-related operations effortlessly.
