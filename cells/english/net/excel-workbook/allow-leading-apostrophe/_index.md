# Allow Leading Apostrophe

## Introduction

Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to manage spreadsheets seamlessly, particularly focusing on handling leading apostrophes in cell values. The ability to manage data effectively is crucial in today's data-centric world. Have you ever noticed how Excel can sometimes treat text values that begin with an apostrophe differently? This can lead to unexpected results if you’re automating Excel tasks with .NET code. Fear not! This tutorial will help you navigate through that. 

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, here are a few prerequisites you need to meet:

1. Basic Knowledge of .NET: Familiarity with the .NET framework is essential. If you already dabble in C# or VB.NET, consider yourself ready.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: You’ll need to have Aspose.Cells installed. You can easily do this via NuGet package manager or download it from the [Aspose site](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. IDE Setup: Ensure you have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio ready for coding.
4. Sample Excel File: You can use the sample file ("AllowLeadingApostropheSample.xlsx") that we’ll work with in the code.

Now that you've checked off the prerequisites, let’s import the necessary packages and set up our project.

## Import Packages

To get started, you'll need to import some essential packages. Here’s how you can do that:

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells.Rendering;
using Aspose.Cells.WebExtensions;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

Ensure you’ve added references to Aspose.Cells in your project. If you're using Visual Studio, you can do this by searching for "Aspose.Cells" under the NuGet Package Manager.

We will break down our tasks into manageable steps to ensure clarity.

## Step 1: Setting Up Source and Output Directories

In this step, we need to define where our input and output files will be located.

```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create a Workbook Designer Object

Now, we will instantiate the WorkbookDesigner, which is crucial for working with smart markers in Aspose.Cells.

```csharp
// Instantiating a WorkbookDesigner object
WorkbookDesigner designer = new WorkbookDesigner();
```

The `WorkbookDesigner` manages the design and data binding of our workbook, making our life easier when converting data into a visual format.

## Step 3: Load the Existing Workbook

Next, we’ll load the existing workbook that contains our smart markers.

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "AllowLeadingApostropheSample.xlsx");
```

The sample Excel file here needs to contain smart markers for this feature to be useful. This way, we can replace the markers with our custom data.

## Step 4: Configure Workbook Settings

Now, you’ll want to ensure the workbook settings are configured to handle leading apostrophes appropriately.

```csharp
workbook.Settings.QuotePrefixToStyle = false;
```

By setting `QuotePrefixToStyle` to false, we're instructing Aspose.Cells to treat leading apostrophes as regular characters, allowing us to handle them accurately in our output.

## Step 5: Load Data for Smart Markers

It’s time to create our data source, which will replace the smart markers in the Excel template.

```csharp
List<DataObject> list = new List<DataObject>
{
    new DataObject { Id = 1, Name = "demo" },
    new DataObject { Id = 2, Name = "'demo" }
};
```

We are creating a list of `DataObject`, where one of the names intentionally includes a leading apostrophe. This will help illustrate how Aspose.Cells deals with such scenarios.

## Step 6: Bind the Data Source to the Designer

Now, we will bind our data source to the workbook designer.

```csharp
designer.SetDataSource("sampleData", list);
```

Ensure that "sampleData" matches the smart markers in your Excel file. This way, Aspose.Cells knows where to insert the data.

## Step 7: Process the Smart Markers

Let’s proceed to process the smart markers with the data we've provided.

```csharp
designer.Process();
```

This line is where the magic happens; Aspose.Cells takes your data and populates the designated smart markers in the Excel workbook.

## Step 8: Save the Processed Workbook

Finally, we save the updated workbook to a new file.

```csharp
designer.Workbook.Save(outputDir + "AllowLeadingApostropheSample_out.xlsx");
```

This saves our manipulated Excel sheet with a new name, ensuring we don’t overwrite the original file.

## Step 9: Confirm Successful Execution

Our last step is to let the user know the operation was successful.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("AllowLeadingApostrophe executed successfully.");
```

This simple console output can reassure you that all steps have been executed without any hiccups.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've navigated through the intricacies of handling leading apostrophes in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET. From setting up your environment to manipulating Excel files effectively, you’ve learned to eliminate potential pitfalls often encountered while working with numeric strings and automatic formatting.

Now, whether you're generating reports, creating functionalities for data analysis, or managing data imports and exports, you have the tools to tackle those scenarios confidently!
