# Add Web Extension

## Introduction

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of adding Web Extensions to an Excel workbook with Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you're building a powerful data dashboard or automating reporting tasks, this tutorial will provide the insights you need to enrich your Excel applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of coding, let's ensure you have everything you need. Here are the prerequisites to get started with Aspose.Cells for .NET:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed, as we will be writing our code in this IDE.
2. .NET Framework: Familiarity with the .NET framework (preferably .NET Core or .NET 5/6).
3. Aspose.Cells Library: You need to have the Aspose.Cells library. If you haven't downloaded it yet, grab the latest version [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) or try it for free [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: A foundational understanding of C# programming will help you follow along with the examples.

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you’re ready to unleash the full potential of Aspose.Cells!

## Import Packages

To work with Aspose.Cells, you first need to import the necessary packages. Here’s how you do it:

1. Open Your Project: In Visual Studio, start by opening your project.
2. Add Reference: Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, select Manage NuGet Packages, and search for `Aspose.Cells`. Install the package to your project.
3. Import Necessary Namespaces: At the top of your code file, you'll want to add the following using directive for the Aspose.Cells namespace:

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
```

Now that you've set up your environment, let's move on to the coding part!

We’re now ready to add a Web Extension to an Excel workbook. Follow these steps closely:

## Step 1: Set Up the Output Directory

First, you need to set up the output directory where you’ll save your modified workbook. This helps keep your files organized.

```csharp
string outDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Create a New Workbook

Next, let’s create a new instance of a Workbook. This is where all the magic happens!

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
This line initializes a new workbook. Think of a workbook as a blank canvas where you’ll add your web extension and other functionalities.

## Step 3: Access Web Extensions and Task Panes Collections

Now, you'll need to access the collections of Web Extensions and Task Panes within the workbook.

```csharp
WebExtensionCollection extensions = workbook.Worksheets.WebExtensions;
WebExtensionTaskPaneCollection taskPanes = workbook.Worksheets.WebExtensionTaskPanes;
```
This retrieves two collections:
- `WebExtensionCollection` holds the web extensions you can add.
- `WebExtensionTaskPaneCollection` manages the task panes associated with those extensions.

## Step 4: Add a New Web Extension

Now, let's add a new web extension to the workbook.

```csharp
int extensionIndex = extensions.Add();
```
The `Add()` method creates a new web extension and returns its index. This lets you access the extension later.

## Step 5: Configure the Web Extension Properties

After adding the extension, it's crucial to configure its properties so it works as intended.

```csharp
WebExtension extension = extensions[extensionIndex];
extension.Reference.Id = "wa104379955";
extension.Reference.StoreName = "en-US";
extension.Reference.StoreType = WebExtensionStoreType.OMEX;
```

- Id: This is the unique identifier for the web extension. You can find available extensions in the Office Store.
- StoreName: Specifies the locale language.
- StoreType: Here, we set it to `OMEX`, which indicates a web extension package.

## Step 6: Add and Configure the Task Pane

Now, let’s add a Task Pane to make our web extension interactive and visible in the Excel UI.

```csharp
int taskPaneIndex = taskPanes.Add();
WebExtensionTaskPane taskPane = taskPanes[taskPaneIndex];
taskPane.IsVisible = true;
taskPane.DockState = "right";
taskPane.WebExtension = extension;
```

- We add a new task pane.
- Setting `IsVisible` to `true` ensures it displays in the workbook.
- The `DockState` property determines where in the Excel UI the task pane will appear (in this case, on the right side).

## Step 7: Save the Workbook

Our final step is to save the workbook, which now includes our web extension.

```csharp
workbook.Save(outDir + "AddWebExtension_Out.xlsx");
```
Here, we save the workbook to the output directory we specified earlier. Replace `"AddWebExtension_Out.xlsx"` with whatever filename you prefer.

## Step 8: Confirm Execution

Finally, let’s print a confirmation message to the console to indicate that everything went smoothly.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("AddWebExtension executed successfully.");
```
It’s always good to have some feedback. This message confirms your extension was added without any hiccups.
