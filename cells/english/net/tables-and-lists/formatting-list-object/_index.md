# Format List Object in Excel with Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to make your Excel data stand out? Well, if you're working with Excel files in .NET, Aspose.Cells is a fantastic library that can do just that. This tool allows you to programmatically create, format, and style tables, among many other advanced Excel tasks. Today, we’ll dive into a specific use case: formatting a list object (or table) in Excel. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know how to create a data table, add styling, and even set summary calculations.
## Prerequisites
Before jumping into the coding process, make sure you have a few things set up:
1. Visual Studio or any .NET IDE: You'll need a development environment to write and run your .NET code.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.Cells for .NET download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) or install it via NuGet in Visual Studio.
3. Basic .NET knowledge: This guide assumes familiarity with C# and .NET.
4. Aspose License (Optional): For full functionality without watermarks, consider getting a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) or purchase one [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

## Import Packages
Once you have everything ready, add the necessary using directives to your code. This ensures all Aspose.Cells functionalities are available in your project.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
Let’s break down the process into digestible steps, each with clear instructions.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory
Before saving any files, let’s specify a directory where our output files will be saved. This directory path will be used to create and store the resulting Excel file.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Check if directory exists; if not, create it
if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir))
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
## Step 2: Create a New Workbook
A workbook in Excel is like a new file or spreadsheet. Here, we create a new instance of the `Workbook` class to hold our data.
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Every new workbook has at least one worksheet by default. Here, we’ll retrieve that first worksheet to work with.
```csharp
Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
## Step 4: Populate Cells with Data
Now comes the fun part—adding data! Let’s populate a series of cells to build a simple data table. This data could represent a small dataset, like quarterly sales by employees and regions.
```csharp
Cells cells = sheet.Cells;
// Add headers
cells["A1"].PutValue("Employee");
cells["B1"].PutValue("Quarter");
cells["C1"].PutValue("Product");
cells["D1"].PutValue("Continent");
cells["E1"].PutValue("Country");
cells["F1"].PutValue("Sale");
// Add sample data
cells["A2"].PutValue("David");
cells["A3"].PutValue("David");
// Add more rows...
cells["B2"].PutValue(1);
cells["C2"].PutValue("Maxilaku");
// Continue adding more data as per requirement
```
This data is just an example. You can customize it according to your specific needs.
## Step 5: Add a List Object (Table) to the Worksheet
In Excel, a "List Object" refers to a table. Let’s add this list object to the range containing our data. This will make it easier to apply formatting and summary functions.
```csharp
Aspose.Cells.Tables.ListObject listObject = sheet.ListObjects[sheet.ListObjects.Add("A1", "F15", true)];
```
Here, `"A1"` to `"F15"` is the range covering our data. The `true` parameter means that the first row (Row 1) should be treated as headers.
## Step 6: Style the Table
Now that our table is set up, let’s add some style to it. Aspose.Cells provides a range of pre-defined table styles, from which you can choose. Here, we’ll apply a medium style.
```csharp
listObject.TableStyleType = TableStyleType.TableStyleMedium10;
```
Experiment with different styles (like `TableStyleMedium9` or `TableStyleDark1`) to find one that suits your needs.
## Step 7: Display Totals Row
Let’s add a totals row to summarize our data. The `ShowTotals` property will enable a new row at the bottom of the table.
```csharp
listObject.ShowTotals = true;
```
## Step 8: Set Calculation Type for the Totals Row
In the totals row, we can specify what type of calculation we want for each column. For example, let’s count the number of entries in the "Quarter" column.
```csharp
listObject.ListColumns[1].TotalsCalculation = TotalsCalculation.Count;
```
This line of code sets the totals calculation for the "Quarter" column to `Count`. You could also use options like `Sum`, `Average`, and more based on your needs.
## Step 9: Save the Workbook
Finally, let’s save the workbook as an Excel file in the directory we set up earlier.
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xlsx");
```
This will create a fully formatted and styled Excel file containing your table.

## Conclusion
And there you have it—a fully styled, functional Excel table created programmatically with Aspose.Cells for .NET. By following this tutorial, you’ve learned how to set up a data table, add styles, and calculate totals, all with just a few lines of code. Aspose.Cells is a powerful tool, and with it, you can create dynamic, visually appealing Excel documents directly from your .NET applications.
