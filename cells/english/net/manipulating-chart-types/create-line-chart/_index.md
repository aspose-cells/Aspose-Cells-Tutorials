# Create Line Chart

## Introduction

Are you ready to visualize your data in stunning clarity? Line charts are a fantastic way to display trends over time or the relationship between two variables. Whether you're managing data for a business project or analyzing personal metrics, the ability to create line charts programmatically can save you time and allow for greater flexibility. In this guide, we will walk you through each step of creating a line chart using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Ready to dive in? Let’s get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of creating a line chart, let’s make sure you're equipped to follow along:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine as it is one of the most popular IDEs for .NET development.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: You’ll need the Aspose.Cells library, which you can download from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will help you understand the examples and code snippets better.
4. .NET Framework or .NET Core: A basic setup of either framework as this will be the foundation for our applications.

Once you've got these prerequisites sorted out, you’re ready to create some charts!

## Import Packages

Now that we've set up our environment, we need to import the necessary packages in our C# code. Just like how you gather your tools before starting a project, importing packages is essential to ensure you have everything you need.

Here’s how you do it:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
```

This line imports the `Aspose.Cells` namespace, which contains all the classes and methods we’ll use to create our line chart.

Now, let's break down the entire process into simple, digestible steps. Each step will guide you through the logical flow of creating a line chart using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

## Step 1: Set Up the Output Directory

The first step is to define where you want to save your output file. It’s like setting up your workspace before you start getting your hands dirty. 

```csharp
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Output Directory"` with the actual path where you want to save the generated Excel file.

## Step 2: Instantiate the Workbook Object

Next, we need to create a new workbook instance. Think of the Workbook as the canvas where your creativity will flow. 

```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
This line initializes a new workbook that will hold all your data and visuals.

## Step 3: Access the Worksheet

In our newly created workbook, we need to obtain a reference to the worksheet where we will input our data. If the workbook is our canvas, then the worksheet is our palette.

```csharp
// Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
Here, we access the first worksheet (index `0`).

## Step 4: Add Sample Values to Cells

Now comes the fun part! We're going to input some sample values into our worksheet. This data will serve as the foundation for our line chart. 

```csharp
// Adding sample values to cells
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(50);
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(100);
worksheet.Cells["A3"].PutValue(150);
worksheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue(4);
worksheet.Cells["B2"].PutValue(20);
worksheet.Cells["B3"].PutValue(50);
```
In this snippet, we’re adding values to cells in the columns A and B. Column A represents the X-axis values, while column B represents the Y-axis values.

## Step 5: Add a Line Chart to the Worksheet

Next up, we’re going to introduce our line chart to the worksheet. This is where your data will truly come to life!

```csharp
// Adding a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.Charts.Add(Aspose.Cells.Charts.ChartType.Line, 5, 0, 25, 10);
```
Here, we add a line chart at the specified location. The parameters (5, 0, 25, 10) define the chart's position and size within the worksheet.

## Step 6: Access the New Chart Instance

Once we've added our chart, it’s time to get our hands on the newly created chart object. 

```csharp
// Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
Aspose.Cells.Charts.Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[chartIndex];
```
This code connects us to the chart so we can manipulate it further.

## Step 7: Add SeriesCollection to the Chart

Now we need to tell our chart what data to display. This is where we define the data source for our line chart by adding a SeriesCollection.

```csharp
// Adding SeriesCollection (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "B3"
chart.NSeries.Add("A1:B3", true);
```
In this example, we’re telling the chart to use the values in cells A1 through B3.

## Step 8: Save the Excel File

The grand finale! After all your hard work, it’s time to save the Excel file and see your line chart in action.

```csharp
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputHowToCreateLineChart.xlsx");
```
This line saves your workbook in the specified output directory with the name `outputHowToCreateLineChart.xlsx`.

## Step 9: Execute and Verify

Finally, you can now run your code and verify that the line chart has been created successfully in your output directory! 

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("HowToCreateLineChart executed successfully.");
```
This will output a message in your console, letting you know that everything ran smoothly.
