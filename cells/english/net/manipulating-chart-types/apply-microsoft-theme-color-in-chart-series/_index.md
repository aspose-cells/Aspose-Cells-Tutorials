# Apply Microsoft Theme Color in Chart Series

## Introduction

In today’s visually-driven world, the way we present data matters greatly. Charts are often the unsung heroes of data presentation, simplifying complex information into digestible visual nuggets. If you're using Microsoft Excel, you know how important it is to customize your charts to match your organization's branding or simply to make them more appealing. But did you know that you can personalize your charts even further with Aspose.Cells for .NET? In this article, we will walk you through the steps to apply Microsoft theme colors in your chart series, ensuring that your data not only stands out but also matches the aesthetic of your other branding materials.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the practical steps, let’s ensure you have everything you need. While this guide is meant to be beginner-friendly, having a basic understanding of programming and .NET concepts will be beneficial. Here’s what you need:

1. .NET Framework: Make sure you have the .NET framework installed on your machine. Aspose.Cells works seamlessly with .NET applications, so you’ll need a compatible version.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: You can get the latest version of the Aspose.Cells library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Visual Studio: A ready development environment like Visual Studio can make your life easier. Make sure you have it installed to write and execute your code.
4. Sample Excel File: You should have a sample Excel file (like `sampleMicrosoftThemeColorInChartSeries.xlsx`) containing at least one chart to practice with.

Now that we have that covered, let’s import the necessary packages to start our journey into customizing our charts.

## Import Packages

To start with, we need to import the required libraries in our C# project. Here’s how you can do that:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
```

Now, let’s break this down into detailed steps to apply Microsoft theme colors in a chart series.

## Step 1: Define Your Output and Source Directories

The first thing you’ll want to do is specify where your output file will go and where your sample file is located. Think of this as setting a destination before you embark on a journey.

```csharp
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";

// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Make sure to replace `"Your Output Directory"` and `"Your Document Directory"` with actual paths on your machine.

## Step 2: Instantiate the Workbook

Next, you need to create an instance of the `Workbook` class, which acts as the heart of our Excel file management. It’s like opening the door to your data.

```csharp
// Instantiate the workbook to open the file that contains a chart
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleMicrosoftThemeColorInChartSeries.xlsx");
```

With this line, we load our existing Excel file into the application.

## Step 3: Access the Worksheet

Once you've got your workbook open, you’ll want to navigate to a specific worksheet. In many cases, your chart will be residing in the first or a specific sheet.

```csharp
// Get the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

Just like turning to a specific page in a book, this step directs us to where we need to make our changes.

## Step 4: Obtain the Chart Object

Now it's time to find the chart that we want to modify. This is where the magic really begins!

```csharp
// Get the first chart in the sheet
Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[0];
```

With this step, we pull the first chart from our worksheet. If you are working with multiple charts, you may want to adjust the index accordingly.

## Step 5: Set the Fill Format for the Chart Series

We need to specify how the chart's series will be filled. We will set it to a solid fill type, which will allow us to apply a theme color.

```csharp
// Specify the FillFormat's type to Solid Fill of the first series
chart.NSeries[0].Area.FillFormat.FillType = Aspose.Cells.Drawing.FillType.Solid;
```

This is analogous to deciding the look and feel of a room before decorating it—set up the base before adding details.

## Step 6: Create a Cells Color Object

Next, we’ll need to define the color for the chart’s fill area. This is how we bring our chosen color to life.

```csharp
// Get the CellsColor of SolidFill
CellsColor cc = chart.NSeries[0].Area.FillFormat.SolidFill.CellsColor;
```

Here, we grab the color setting for the chart series.

## Step 7: Apply the Theme Color

Now, let's apply a Microsoft theme color. We’ll choose an `Accent` style because who doesn’t love a pop of color?

```csharp
// Create a theme in Accent style
cc.ThemeColor = new ThemeColor(ThemeColorType.Accent6, 0.6);
```

With just a couple of lines here, you've specified that your chart series should reflect a certain theme color, adding elegance and branding to your visuals.

## Step 8: Set the Cells Color

Once the theme is defined, it’s time to apply it to our chart series. This is the moment we see our design take shape!

```csharp
// Apply the theme to the series
chart.NSeries[0].Area.FillFormat.SolidFill.CellsColor = cc;
```

At this point, the envisioned color is officially on your series. How exciting is that?

## Step 9: Save the Workbook

Finally, you've done all the legwork, and now you need to save your work. Think of this as stepping back and admiring your beautifully decorated room.

```csharp
// Save the Excel file
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputMicrosoftThemeColorInChartSeries.xlsx");
```

Your Excel file, now brimming with color and personality, is ready to be showcased!

## Step 10: Confirmation Message

As a nice touch, you might want to add a confirmation message at the end of the process. It’s always nice to know that everything has worked out, right?

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("MicrosoftThemeColorInChartSeries executed successfully.");
```
