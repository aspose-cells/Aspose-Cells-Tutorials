# Create Custom Chart

## Introduction

Creating custom charts in Excel using the Aspose.Cells library for .NET is not just straightforward, but it's a fantastic way to visualize your data effectively. Charts can transform mundane data into compelling stories, making it easier for analysts and decision-makers to glean insights. In this tutorial, we're diving deep into how you can create custom charts within your applications. So, if you're looking to elevate your reports or simply add flair to your data presentation, you're in the right place!

## Prerequisites

Before we delve into the nitty-gritty of chart creation, let’s ensure you have everything in place. Here’s what you need:

1. Visual Studio or any .NET-compatible IDE: This will be your playground for writing and testing your code.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET Library: Make sure you have this library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic understanding of C#: It would be beneficial for you to grasp basic C# concepts, as we will be using it in our code examples.
4. A sample dataset: For creating charts, having some data is essential. We’ll be using a simple dataset in our example, but you can adapt it to your needs.

## Import Packages

To get started, you'll need to import the necessary Aspose.Cells namespace in your C# application. Here’s how you can do this:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
```

Now that the basic structure is laid out, let’s get into the step-by-step guide on creating a custom chart.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Output Directory

First things first, you'll need to create a directory where your Excel file will be saved. This step is crucial to ensure that your application knows where to place its final product.

```csharp
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory"; // Change this to your desired path
```

In place of "Your Output Directory," you can specify an actual path where you'd like the Excel file to be saved. Make sure this directory exists on your system; otherwise, you'll run into errors later on.

## Step 2: Instantiating a Workbook Object

Now, you’ll want to kick things off by creating a new instance of the `Workbook` class. This is the fundamental building block for any Excel operations using Aspose.Cells.

```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

This line of code initializes a new workbook, and you’re all set to start adding data and charts!

## Step 3: Accessing the Worksheet

Next, you need to obtain a reference to the worksheet where your data will reside. In this case, we'll work with the first worksheet in the workbook.

```csharp
// Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

This line accesses the first worksheet (index 0). Aspose.Cells allows you to have multiple worksheets, so you can choose accordingly.

## Step 4: Adding Sample Data to the Worksheet


With the worksheet ready, now it’s time to add some sample data to your cells. A simple dataset will help us visualize through charts more effectively.

```csharp
// Adding sample values to cells
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(50);
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(100);
worksheet.Cells["A3"].PutValue(150);
worksheet.Cells["A4"].PutValue(110);
worksheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue(260);
worksheet.Cells["B2"].PutValue(12);
worksheet.Cells["B3"].PutValue(50);
worksheet.Cells["B4"].PutValue(100);
```

Here, we are putting values in the ranges A1 through B4. Feel free to modify these values to test different data scenarios.

## Step 5: Adding a Chart to the Worksheet

Now we’re getting to the exciting part—adding a chart that will visually represent the data we've just entered. You can choose among various chart types available in Aspose.Cells.

```csharp
// Adding a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.Charts.Add(ChartType.Column, 5, 0, 25, 10);
```

In this line, we are adding a column chart. You can also use other types like line, pie, or bar charts based on your needs.

## Step 6: Accessing the Chart Instance

Once we’ve added the chart, we need to reference it so that we can manipulate it further. Here’s how:

```csharp
// Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
Aspose.Cells.Charts.Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[chartIndex];
```

At this point, you have a `chart` object that allows you to modify its properties as needed.

## Step 7: Adding Data Series to the Chart

Now, you need to inform the chart where to fetch its data from. This is done by adding a data series in Aspose.Cells.

```csharp
// Adding NSeries (chart data source) to the chart
chart.NSeries.Add("A1:B4", true);
```

This line effectively connects your chart to the data points you've placed in the cells, allowing the chart to display these values.

## Step 8: Customizing the Series Type

You can further customize your chart by changing the type of any series. For example, let’s change the second series to a line chart for better visual clarity.

```csharp
// Setting the chart type of 2nd NSeries to display as line chart
chart.NSeries[1].Type = Aspose.Cells.Charts.ChartType.Line;
```

This allows for mixed-type charts, offering unique visualization opportunities.

## Step 9: Saving the Workbook

After all those configurations, it’s time to save your Excel file. Here’s how you can do it:

```csharp
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputHowToCreateCustomChart.xlsx");
```

Make sure you add the file name with the `.xlsx` extension to ensure the workbook gets saved correctly.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You've just created a custom chart using Aspose.Cells for .NET. With just a few lines of code, you can now visualize your data effectively, making reports and presentations far more engaging. 

Remember, the power of charts lies in their ability to tell a story, to make complex data understandable at a glance. So go ahead, experiment with different datasets and chart types, and let your data do the talking!
