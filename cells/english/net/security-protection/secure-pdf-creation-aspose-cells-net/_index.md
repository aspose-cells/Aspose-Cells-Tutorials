        // Initialize a new Workbook object
        var workbook = new Workbook("path_to_your_file.xlsx");

        Console.WriteLine("Aspose.Cells setup completed.");
    }
}
```
## Implementation Guide
### Overview of Secure PDF Creation
This section guides you through creating password-protected PDF documents using Aspose.Cells, configuring security options to restrict unauthorized access.
#### Step 1: Open an Excel File
Start by loading your source Excel file. Ensure directory paths are correctly specified for both input and output files.
```csharp
string sourceDir = RunExamples.Get_SourceDirectory();
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleSecurePDFDocuments.xlsx");
```
#### Step 2: Configure PDF Security Options
Instantiate `PdfSaveOptions` to manage security attributes, including user and owner passwords, as well as permission settings.
```csharp
// Instantiate PdfSaveOptions to manage security attributes
PdfSaveOptions saveOption = new PdfSaveOptions();
saveOption.SecurityOptions = new Aspose.Cells.Rendering.PdfSecurity.PdfSecurityOptions();

// Set the user password
saveOption.SecurityOptions.UserPassword = "user";

// Set the owner password
saveOption.SecurityOptions.OwnerPassword = "owner";
```
#### Step 3: Disable Permissions
Enhance security by disabling permissions for content extraction and printing.
```csharp
// Disable extracting content permission
saveOption.SecurityOptions.ExtractContentPermission = false;

// Disable print permission
saveOption.SecurityOptions.PrintPermission = false;
```
#### Step 4: Save the Encrypted PDF
Finally, save your workbook as a secure PDF file with specified encryption settings.
```csharp
string outputDir = RunExamples.Get_OutputDirectory();
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputSecurePDFDocuments.pdf", saveOption);

Console.WriteLine("SecurePDFDocuments executed successfully.");
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Errors:** Ensure that source and output directories are correct.
- **Library Compatibility:** Verify you're using the compatible version of Aspose.Cells for your .NET environment.
