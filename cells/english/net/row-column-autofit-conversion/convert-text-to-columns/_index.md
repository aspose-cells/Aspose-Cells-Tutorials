# Convert Text to Columns in Aspose.Cells .NET

## Introduction
In today’s fast-paced world of data management, efficiency is key. Whether you’re an analyst crunching numbers or a business professional preparing reports, you often find yourself needing to manipulate data quickly and accurately. If you’ve ever had to deal with names in a single cell that you needed to split into separate columns, you know how tedious it can be. Thankfully, Aspose.Cells for .NET provides an elegant solution for splitting text into columns. In this guide, we’re going to walk through the process of converting text to columns using Aspose.Cells.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive in, let’s make sure you’re all set up. Here’s what you need:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. If you don’t have it yet, you can download it from [Microsoft’s site](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. .NET Framework: Ensure that you’re working in a project that targets a compatible version of the .NET Framework. Aspose.Cells is compatible with .NET Core, .NET Framework, and other platforms.
3. Aspose.Cells Library: You need to have the Aspose.Cells library downloaded and referenced in your project. You can get it from the [Aspose Downloads page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand this tutorial more easily.
## Import Packages
To get things rolling, we'll need to import the necessary Aspose.Cells packages. Here’s how you can do that:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
```
This allows you to access all the necessary functionality of Aspose.Cells for manipulating your data.
Now that we have everything in place, let’s start by breaking down the conversion of text to columns into several easy-to-follow steps.
## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory
First, you need to configure the directory where you’ll be saving your output file. It’s always a good idea to structure your files neatly; this makes managing them easy.
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
- Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where you want to save your file. For example, you might use `C:\\Documents\\AsposeOutput\\`.
## Step 2: Create a Workbook Instance
Next, let’s create our workbook. This is essentially the file where all your data will be processed.
```csharp
// Create a workbook instance.
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
- Think of the workbook as a blank canvas. You can paint however you like!
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
Now that we have a workbook, we need to access the first worksheet to begin adding our data.
```csharp
// Access the first worksheet.
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
- The worksheet is like a page in your workbook. You can have multiple pages, but we’ll focus on the first one for simplicity’s sake.
## Step 4: Add Data to the Worksheet
Let’s populate our worksheet with some names. We’ll be inputting a list of names where the first and last names are separated by a space.
```csharp
// Add people names in column A. First name and Last name are separated by space.
ws.Cells["A1"].PutValue("John Teal");
ws.Cells["A2"].PutValue("Peter Graham");
ws.Cells["A3"].PutValue("Brady Cortez");
ws.Cells["A4"].PutValue("Mack Nick");
ws.Cells["A5"].PutValue("Hsu Lee");
```
- You’ll want to adjust your names as necessary; maybe you want to test with your own name list or create a more diverse set.
## Step 5: Create Text Load Options
Before splitting the names, we must define how we want to split the text. In this case, we’ll use a space as the delimiter.
```csharp
// Create text load options with space as separator.
TxtLoadOptions opts = new TxtLoadOptions();
opts.Separator = ' ';
```
- By defining space as our separator, we inform Aspose that this is where it should split the names.
## Step 6: Split the Column into Multiple Columns
Here comes the magic! We’ll now split the contents of column A into two separate columns (first names in column A and last names in column B) using the `TextToColumns` method.
```csharp
// Split column A into two columns using TextToColumns() method.
// Now column A will have first name and column B will have last name.
ws.Cells.TextToColumns(0, 0, 5, opts);
```
- This step takes all the hard work off your shoulders. It’s like having a diligent little helper that knows just what to do!
## Step 7: Save the Workbook
Finally, let’s save our workbook with the changes we made. It’s always satisfying to see your work saved cleanly!
```csharp
// Save the workbook in xlsx format.
wb.Save(dataDir + "outputTextToColumns.xlsx");
```
- Make sure you give the file a meaningful name. In this case, we’re saving it as `outputTextToColumns.xlsx`, but feel free to rename it to whatever you see fit.
