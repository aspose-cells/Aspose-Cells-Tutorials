## Introduction

When working with Excel files in .NET, presenting data in a clean, readable format is essential. Aspose.Cells for .NET provides tools to automate this, making it simple to adjust rows and columns for your data needs. Below is a rundown of essential auto-fit tutorials for both rows and columns using Aspose.Cells for .NET, perfect for enhancing your data presentation and streamlining spreadsheet management.

## Auto-fit Columns in Specific Ranges
Sometimes, you need to auto-fit only a specific section of your spreadsheet. Aspose.Cells makes it easy to auto-fit columns in selected ranges, focusing on essential areas without affecting the entire sheet. This feature allows you to tailor your data display for specific datasets or reports.
