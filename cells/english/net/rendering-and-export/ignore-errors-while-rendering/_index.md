# Ignore Errors in Excel to PDF Rendering with Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
Converting Excel files to PDF can be a breeze with the right tools. However, have you ever encountered errors during conversion that halted your workflow? It’s frustrating, isn't it? Luckily, Aspose.Cells for .NET offers a robust solution. In this tutorial, we’ll dive deep into how to ignore errors when rendering Excel files to PDF using Aspose.Cells. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting, this guide will help you seamlessly navigate the conversion process while addressing those pesky errors.
## Prerequisites
Before you embark on this journey, there are a few prerequisites you'll need to set the stage for smooth sailing:
1. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Make sure you have this powerful library installed in your development environment. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
2. .NET Framework: Ensure that you are working with a compatible version of the .NET framework.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A fundamental understanding of C# programming is essential, as examples will be written in this language.
4. Visual Studio or Any IDE: Have your development environment ready to write and run your code.
With these prerequisites checked off your list, let’s jump into the fun part: writing some code!
## Import Packages
To get started, you need to import the necessary packages. Here’s how to set things up:
### Create a New Project
Start by creating a new C# console application in your preferred IDE (like Visual Studio).
### Add the Aspose.Cells Reference
Once your project is set up, add a reference to Aspose.Cells by navigating to the NuGet package manager, searching for "Aspose.Cells," and installing it.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
## Step 1: Set Up the Directory
Decide on the directories where your source Excel files and output PDFs will be saved. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path on your machine.
```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "C:\\Your\\Path\\Here\\";
// Output directory
string outputDir = "C:\\Your\\Path\\Here\\Output\\";
```
With all the foundational blocks in place, let's put it all together in a step-by-step guide.
## Step 2: Load the Excel Workbook
Here’s where you tell Aspose.Cells which Excel file you want to convert. This example assumes you're using a sample file named `sampleErrorExcel2Pdf.xlsx` that may have errors preventing a smooth conversion.
```csharp
// Load the Sample Workbook that throws Error on Excel2Pdf conversion
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleErrorExcel2Pdf.xlsx");
```
## Step 3: Set Pdf Save Options
Next, we need to create a `PdfSaveOptions` object. This object allows us to specify different settings, such as ignoring errors during conversion.
```csharp
// Specify Pdf Save Options - Ignore Error
PdfSaveOptions opts = new PdfSaveOptions();
opts.IgnoreError = true;  // This is the golden ticket!
```
## Step 4: Save the Workbook as PDF
Now, it’s time to save the loaded workbook as a PDF file. We’ll use the previously configured `PdfSaveOptions`.
```csharp
// Save the Workbook in PDF with Pdf Save Options
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputErrorExcel2Pdf.pdf", opts);
```
## Step 5: Confirm Success
To let the user know everything worked out, let’s print a simple confirmation in the console.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("IgnoreErrorsWhileRenderingExcelToPdf executed successfully.\r\n");
```

## Conclusion
And there you have it! You've successfully set up an environment to ignore errors when converting Excel files to PDF using Aspose.Cells. This approach not only saves you time but also helps in maintaining productivity, especially when dealing with large volumes of files that might not be in perfect shape. Now that you’ve got the hang of it, imagine the possibilities—automating your report generation, handling complex financial models, and more—all without the headache of error messages interrupting your flow. 
## FAQ's
### What if my Excel file doesn't load?
