# Create PDF Bookmark for Chart Sheet in Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
Aspose.Cells for .NET allows developers to manipulate Excel files programmatically. One of its handy features is the ability to create PDF bookmarks for individual chart sheets. This tutorial will walk you through the process step by step, making it easy for you to follow along, regardless of your programming experience. Grab your code editor, and let’s dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, let’s make sure you have everything you need to follow along:
1. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You'll need the Aspose.Cells library. If you haven't got it yet, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
2. Visual Studio or any .NET IDE: You’ll need a development environment where you can write and execute your C# code.
3. Basic Understanding of C#: While we’ll guide you through each step, a fundamental knowledge of C# coding will come in handy.
4. Sample Excel File: Get your hands on a sample Excel file that includes charts. You can create one yourself or use a sample file for this exercise.
With these prerequisites checked off, you're ready to create PDF bookmarks for chart sheets with ease!
## Import Packages
Now that we're all set with the prerequisites, let’s jump into the code. Before you can start manipulating Excel files, you need to import the necessary packages. Here’s how you do it:
### Setup Your Development Environment
1. Create a New Project: Open Visual Studio and create a new C# console application. Let’s call it “AsposePDFBookmarkExample”.
2. Add Aspose.Cells Reference: Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, select "Manage NuGet Packages," and search for "Aspose.Cells". Install the latest version.
3. Add Using Directives:
In your `Program.cs` file, add the following lines at the top:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Rendering;
```
These packages allow you to work with Excel files and rendering them into PDFs with bookmarks.
Let’s break down the code for creating PDF bookmarks. We’ll go through each part step by step.
## Step 1: Define Your Directory Paths
To organize your code, let’s define where our files are located.
```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory"; // e.g., @"C:\Documents\"
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"; // e.g., @"C:\Documents\Output\"
```
Replace `Your Document Directory` with the actual paths where your sample Excel file is stored and where you want the output PDF to be saved.
## Step 2: Load the Excel Workbook
Next, we need to load the Excel workbook that you want to manipulate.
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleCreatePdfBookmarkEntryForChartSheet.xlsx");
```
Here we create an instance of the `Workbook` class, loading our sample Excel file. Make sure the filename matches your actual file.
## Step 3: Access Worksheets
Once the workbook is loaded, you can access its worksheets. 
```csharp
Worksheet sheet1 = wb.Worksheets[0];
Worksheet sheet2 = wb.Worksheets[1];
Worksheet sheet3 = wb.Worksheets[2];
Worksheet sheet4 = wb.Worksheets[3];
```
The code references the four worksheets in the workbook. Make sure your Excel file has at least four sheets.
## Step 4: Create PDF Bookmark Entries
Here’s where the magic happens! We’ll create bookmark entries for each sheet.
```csharp
PdfBookmarkEntry ent1 = new PdfBookmarkEntry {
    Destination = sheet1.Cells["A1"],
    Text = "Bookmark-I"
};
PdfBookmarkEntry ent2 = new PdfBookmarkEntry {
    Destination = sheet2.Cells["A1"],
    Text = "Bookmark-II-Chart1"
};
PdfBookmarkEntry ent3 = new PdfBookmarkEntry {
    Destination = sheet3.Cells["A1"],
    Text = "Bookmark-III"
};
PdfBookmarkEntry ent4 = new PdfBookmarkEntry {
    Destination = sheet4.Cells["A1"],
    Text = "Bookmark-IV-Chart2"
};
```
Each `PdfBookmarkEntry` object has a destination cell and a text label. This setup will create bookmarks in the PDF that correspond to areas in the Excel sheets.
## Step 5: Arrange the Bookmark Entries
To create a hierarchical structure of bookmarks, we need to organize them.
```csharp
ArrayList lst = new ArrayList();
ent1.SubEntry = lst;
lst.Add(ent2);
lst.Add(ent3);
lst.Add(ent4);
```
This code adds the second, third, and fourth bookmarks as sub-entries under the first bookmark. Now, when you click on "Bookmark-I" in the PDF, it will lead you to the other bookmarks.
## Step 6: Create PDF Save Options with Bookmark Entries
Now, let’s prepare the PDF saving options with our bookmarks.
```csharp
PdfSaveOptions opts = new PdfSaveOptions();
opts.Bookmark = ent1;
```
The `PdfSaveOptions` configuration allows us to include bookmarks when the PDF is saved.
## Step 7: Save the Output PDF
Finally, it’s time to save your work!
```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputCreatePdfBookmarkEntryForChartSheet.pdf", opts);
```
This command saves the workbook into a PDF file at the specified output path, complete with your nifty bookmarks.
## Step 8: Execution Confirmation
Lastly, let’s print out a success message to confirm everything went smoothly.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("CreatePdfBookmarkEntryForChartSheet executed successfully.");
```
## Conclusion 
Creating PDF bookmarks for chart sheets using Aspose.Cells for .NET is a straightforward process that can enhance the usability of your Excel documents. With just a few lines of code, you can navigate easily through your PDF, saving valuable time and improving your workflow.
Whether you are generating reports or maintaining complex datasets, these bookmarks make accessing information much easier. So go ahead, take control of your documents and enrich them with this fantastic feature!
