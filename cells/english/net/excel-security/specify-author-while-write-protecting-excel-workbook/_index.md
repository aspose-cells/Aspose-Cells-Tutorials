# Specify Author While Write Protecting Excel Workbook

## Introduction

When it comes to working with Excel files in .NET applications, Aspose.Cells is a go-to solution for many developers. Its rich set of functionalities allows you to generate, manipulate, and secure Excel files easily. One common requirement developers face is writing to an Excel workbook while ensuring it is protected against unauthorized edits. Further, specifying an author can be incredibly useful for tracking purposes when sharing the document. In this guide, we’re going to take a deep dive into how you can specify the author while write protecting an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of implementation, it's essential to have a solid foundation. Here are the prerequisites you'll need to get started:

1. Visual Studio: You need a working installation of Visual Studio. This is where you'll write and compile your .NET code.
2. .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed. Aspose.Cells supports various versions, so choose one that suits your application.
3. Aspose.Cells Library: You need to have the Aspose.Cells library. You can get this from the [official download page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
4. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# will help you navigate through the coding process effortlessly.

## Import Packages

To make the most out of the functionality provided by Aspose.Cells, let’s start by importing the necessary packages. Begin your C# file by adding the following using directive:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

This directive will allow you to access the classes and methods included in the Aspose.Cells library. Now that we’ve got our packages imported, let’s move on to the fun part—writing the code!

## Step 1: Set Up Your Directories

Before you initiate the workbook, it's a good idea to set up the paths where your source files are located and where you’d like to save your output. Here’s how to do that:

```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "YOUR SOURCE DIRECTORY";

// Output directory
string outputDir = "YOUR OUTPUT DIRECTORY";
```

Make sure to replace `"YOUR SOURCE DIRECTORY"` and `"YOUR OUTPUT DIRECTORY"` with actual paths on your machine. Think of this as creating a tidy workspace before you start crafting your masterpiece!

## Step 2: Create an Empty Workbook

Now that we have our directories set up, the next step is to create an empty workbook. This is essentially the canvas where you'll be writing your data.

```csharp
// Create empty workbook.
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

Just like an artist starts with a blank canvas, you're starting with an empty workbook where you can later include data or formatting.

## Step 3: Write Protect the Workbook

Write protection is a crucial aspect, especially if you want to ensure that the integrity of your data remains intact. You can do that with a password.

```csharp
// Write protect workbook with password.
wb.Settings.WriteProtection.Password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
```

In this line, replace `"YOUR_PASSWORD"` with a strong password of your choosing. This password acts like a locked door—only those with the key (password) can enter.

## Step 4: Specify the Author

Now we’ll specify the author of the workbook. This is especially useful for accountability and allows others to see who created or modified the file.

```csharp
// Specify author while write protecting workbook.
wb.Settings.WriteProtection.Author = "YOUR_AUTHOR";
```

Make sure to replace `"YOUR_AUTHOR"` with the name you want to associate with the document. Think of this as signing your artwork—it lets people know who to thank for this piece!

## Step 5: Save the Workbook

The final step is to save the workbook in the desired format. In this case, we'll save it as an XLSX file. 

```csharp
// Save the workbook in XLSX format.
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputSpecifyAuthorWhileWriteProtectingWorkbook.xlsx");
```

Here, the output file will be saved in your specified output directory with the name `outputSpecifyAuthorWhileWriteProtectingWorkbook.xlsx`. This is where your hard work finally pays off, and you can share your workbook with others, knowing it’s well protected!

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve learned how to create an Excel workbook, set write protection with a password, specify an author, and save it seamlessly using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This combination of functionalities will not only secure your data but also maintain its integrity and provide proper attribution.
