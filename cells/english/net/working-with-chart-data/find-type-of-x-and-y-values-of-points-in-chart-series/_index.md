# Find Type of X and Y Values of Points in Chart Series

## Introduction

Creating meaningful charts and visual data representations is essential in data analysis. With features available in libraries like Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can delve into the properties of chart series, specifically the X and Y values of data points. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to determine the types of these values, enabling you to better understand and manipulate your data visualizations.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the steps, ensure you have a few things ready:

1. .NET Environment: You should have a .NET development environment set up. This could be Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other compatible IDE.
   
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You will need to have Aspose.Cells for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).

3. Sample Excel File: Get a sample Excel file that contains charts. For this tutorial, we'll be using a file named `sampleFindTypeOfXandYValuesOfPointsInChartSeries.xlsx`. Ensure it’s in your project directory.

4. Basic Programming Knowledge: Familiarity with C# programming will help you follow along easily.

## Import Packages

To interact with the Excel data and charts, you need to import the relevant packages from Aspose.Cells. Here’s how you do it:

### Setup Your Project

Open your IDE and create a new .NET project. Make sure you have installed the Aspose.Cells package via NuGet or by adding reference to the .DLL file.

### Import Required Namespaces

At the top of your C# file, include the following using directives:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;

using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
```

These namespaces provide access to the workbook, worksheets, and chart functionalities of Aspose.Cells.

Now, let’s break down the process of determining the types of X and Y values in your chart series. Here’s how you can do it step by step.

## Step 1: Define the Source Directory

First, you need to define the directory where your Excel file is located. Set the path to point correctly to your file.

```csharp
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where your Excel file is saved.

## Step 2: Load the Workbook

Next, load the Excel file into a `Workbook` object. This allows you to access all the contents of the file.

```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleFindTypeOfXandYValuesOfPointsInChartSeries.xlsx");
```

## Step 3: Access the Worksheet

After loading the workbook, you need to specify which worksheet contains the chart you want to analyze. We will use the first worksheet:

```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 4: Access the Chart

In this step, you need to access the first chart present in the worksheet. Chart objects contain all the information regarding series and data points.

```csharp
Chart ch = ws.Charts[0];
```

## Step 5: Calculate Chart Data

Before accessing individual data points, it’s important to calculate the chart's data to ensure all values are up-to-date.

```csharp
ch.Calculate();
```

## Step 6: Access a Specific Chart Point

Now, let’s retrieve the first chart point from the first series. You can modify the index if you need to access different points or series.

```csharp
ChartPoint pnt = ch.NSeries[0].Points[0];
```

## Step 7: Determine the X and Y Value Types

Finally, you can investigate the types of the X and Y values for the chart point. This information is essential for understanding the data representation.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("X Value Type: " + pnt.XValueType);
Console.WriteLine("Y Value Type: " + pnt.YValueType);
```

## Step 8: Conclusion of the Execution

It’s always beneficial to notify that your code executed successfully. To do this, add another Console output statement:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("FindTypeOfXandYValuesOfPointsInChartSeries executed successfully.");
```

## Conclusion

With this guide, you should be able to successfully retrieve and identify the types of X and Y values in the chart series using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you’re making decisions based on data or just need to present it visually, understanding these values is critical. So, go ahead, explore further and make your data presentations more meaningful!
