# Advanced Operations with Named Ranges in Excel

## Introduction

When diving into advanced Excel functionalities, named ranges stand out. They are like bookmarks within your spreadsheets, allowing you to refer to data without hunting through rows and columns. So, what’s the benefit? Imagine a huge data set where you need to apply specific operations. Instead of constantly scrolling and searching, you can simply use the named range you created! 

## Identify Cells in Named Range in Excel

Let’s kick things off with how to effortlessly identify cells within a named range using Aspose.Cells for .NET. The process is seamless! First, you’ll define a named range in your Excel file. Aspose makes this incredibly user-friendly. All you need is a few lines of code to access and manipulate your data. By being able to identify specific cells in a named range, you can streamline your workflow significantly.
