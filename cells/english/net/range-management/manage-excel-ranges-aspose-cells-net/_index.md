## Implementation Guide

### Create and Name a Range of Cells in an Excel Worksheet
This feature will show you how to create a specific range within a worksheet and assign it a name for easy reference.

#### Overview
You'll learn how to define a cell range from A1 to C10 and name this range with sheet reference, making your data more accessible.

#### Implementation Steps

##### Step 1: Initialize the Workbook
Create an instance of `Workbook` which represents an Excel file.
```csharp
string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Create a new Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

##### Step 2: Access the Worksheet and Cells Collection
Get access to the first worksheet in your workbook and its cells collection.
```csharp
// Get the first worksheet of the workbook
Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Access the cells collection of the worksheet
Cells cells = sheet.Cells;
```

##### Step 3: Create a Range of Cells
Define a range within the cells, specifying your desired start and end positions.
```csharp
// Create a range of Cells from A1 to C10
Range localRange = cells.CreateRange("A1", "C10");
```

##### Step 4: Assign a Name with Sheet Reference
Name the created range for easier identification and reference within formulas or scripts.
```csharp
// Assign a name with sheet reference to the created range
localRange.Name = "Sheet1!local";
```

##### Step 5: Save Your Workbook
Persist your changes by saving the workbook to a specified directory.
```csharp
// Save the workbook to the specified output directory
workbook.Save(Path.Combine(outputDir, "outputWorksheetNamedRange.xlsx"));
```

### Initialize and Configure Aspose.Cells Workbook
This part covers creating an empty Excel file using Aspose.Cells.

#### Overview
Learn how to initialize a new workbook instance and save it as an Excel file in your desired location.

#### Implementation Steps

##### Step 1: Create the Workbook Object
Initialize a `Workbook` object which represents a new Excel file.
```csharp
// Create a new Workbook object, representing an Excel file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

##### Step 2: Save the New Workbook
Store your newly created workbook to a specified directory.
```csharp
// Save the newly created workbook to the specified directory
workbook.Save(Path.Combine(outputDir, "newWorkbook.xlsx"));
```
