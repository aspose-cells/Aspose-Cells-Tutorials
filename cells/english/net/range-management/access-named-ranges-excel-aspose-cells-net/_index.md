        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Set up the license if you have one
            License license = new License();
            license.SetLicense("Aspose.Total.lic");

            Console.WriteLine("Aspose.Cells is ready to use.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
This section breaks down the process of accessing all named ranges in an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

### Opening an Excel Workbook
**Overview:**
Begin by loading your Excel workbook into memory. This step allows you to work with the data programmatically.

#### Step 1: Define Source Directory and File Path
```csharp
// Source directory
static string sourceDir = RunExamples.Get_SourceDirectory();
```

#### Step 2: Load the Workbook
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleAccessAllNamedRanges.xlsx");
```

### Retrieving All Named Ranges
**Overview:**
Once your workbook is loaded, you can access all named ranges.

#### Step 1: Get Named Ranges Collection
```csharp
Range[] rangeArray = workbook.Worksheets.GetNamedRanges();
```

#### Step 2: Display the Number of Named Ranges
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Total Number of Named Ranges: " + rangeArray.Length);
```

### Explanation and Parameters
- **Workbook**: Represents an Excel file.
- **Range[]**: Array to store all named ranges.

**Method Purpose:** `GetNamedRanges()` retrieves an array of Range objects representing all named ranges in the workbook.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your Excel file path is correct.
- Verify that Aspose.Cells is properly installed and licensed.

## Practical Applications
