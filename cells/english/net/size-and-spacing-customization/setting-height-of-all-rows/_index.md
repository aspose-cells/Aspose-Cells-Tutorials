# Set Height of All Rows in Excel with Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
In the fast-paced world of data management, having control over how your spreadsheets look is essential. You might find yourself needing to adjust the height of rows in Excel for better visibility, organization, or simply to enhance the overall aesthetics of your work. If you're working with .NET applications, Aspose.Cells is an incredible library that allows you to manipulate Excel files with ease. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the straightforward process of setting the height of all rows in an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells. Let's dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the coding part, let's ensure you have everything you need to get started:
- Aspose.Cells for .NET: If you don't have it yet, download it from the [Aspose Downloads page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
- Visual Studio: A development environment to write and run your C# code.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Understanding the fundamentals of C# will help you grasp how the code works.
## Import Packages
To begin coding with Aspose.Cells, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. Here's how to do it:
### Create a new C# Project
First, open Visual Studio and create a new C# project.
### Add Aspose.Cells Library
Next, you need to add the Aspose.Cells library to your project. If you downloaded the library, you can reference its DLL like any other library.
If you prefer a more automated approach, you can also install it via NuGet Package Manager by executing:
```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```
### Include the Required Namespaces
At the top of your C# file, include the following namespaces:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
These namespaces will provide the necessary classes and methods to manipulate your Excel files.
Now, let’s break down the process of setting the height of all rows in your Excel file.
## Step 1: Define the Directory Path
The first step is to specify the path of your Excel file. This is crucial because it tells your application where to find the file you want to manipulate.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your Excel file is saved. For example: `C:\Documents\`.
## Step 2: Create a File Stream
Next, you need to create a `FileStream` that will be used to access the Excel file. This allows you to open and manipulate the file.
```csharp
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(dataDir + "book1.xls", FileMode.Open);
```
Ensure "book1.xls" is the name of your Excel file. The `FileMode.Open` parameter indicates that you're opening an existing file.
## Step 3: Instantiate a Workbook Object
Now it’s time to create an instance of the `Workbook` class to load your Excel file into memory.
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
```
This line reads the Excel file you opened with the `FileStream` and prepares it for manipulation.
## Step 4: Access the Worksheet
Aspose.Cells allows you to access individual worksheets within your workbook. Here, we’ll access the first worksheet.
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
The worksheets are indexed starting from zero, so `[0]` refers to the first worksheet in your workbook.
## Step 5: Set Row Height
Now, we are ready to set the height of all rows. By using the `StandardHeight` property, you can define a standard height for each row in the worksheet.
```csharp
worksheet.Cells.StandardHeight = 15;
```
In this example, we’re setting the height of all rows to 15. Feel free to adjust the number based on your needs.
## Step 6: Save the Modified File
After making all your changes, it's essential to save the modified workbook to a new file or overwrite the existing one.
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xls");
```
This line saves the new Excel file as "output.out.xls" in the specified directory. If you want to overwrite the original file, just use the same name.
## Step 7: Clean Up Resources
Lastly, it’s a good habit to close the `FileStream` to avoid any resource leaks in your application.
```csharp
fstream.Close();
```
This line ensures that all system resources used by the `FileStream` are released, which is crucial for maintaining performance.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully learned how to set the height of all rows in an Excel worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Not only does this skill improve the readability of your data, but it also adds a professional touch to your reports and spreadsheets. With Aspose.Cells, the possibilities are vast, and tweaking Excel files has never been easier.
