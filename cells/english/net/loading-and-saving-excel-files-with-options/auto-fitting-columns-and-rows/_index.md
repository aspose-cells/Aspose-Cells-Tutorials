# Auto-Fit Columns and Rows while Loading HTML in Workbook

## Introduction
Ever wondered how to automatically adjust the column and row sizes while loading HTML content into an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET? Well, you're in the right place! In this tutorial, we'll dive deep into how you can load an HTML table into a workbook and ensure that the columns and rows are auto-fitted to match the content. If you're working with dynamic data that changes frequently, this guide will be your go-to for creating well-formatted Excel sheets from HTML.
### Prerequisites
Before jumping into the code, there are a few things you need to have set up on your system. Don’t worry, it's simple and straightforward!
1. Visual Studio Installed: You’ll need Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You can [download the latest version](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) or use the NuGet package manager to install it.
3. .NET Framework: Ensure you have .NET Framework 4.0 or higher installed.
4. Basic Understanding of C#: Having some knowledge of C# will make this tutorial smoother for you.
5. HTML Table Data: Prepare some HTML content (even a basic table) that you want to load into Excel.
## Import Packages
First thing’s first—let’s import the necessary namespaces to get started. Here’s a simple list of what you need to import:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.IO;
```
These packages allow you to handle the workbook, manipulate HTML data, and load it seamlessly into Excel.
Let’s break this process down into manageable chunks so you can follow along easily. By the end of this, you’ll have a working example of how to auto-fit columns and rows while loading HTML into a workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET.
## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory
To save and retrieve files easily, we’ll specify the path where your documents will be stored. You can replace the directory path with your own folder location.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
This line sets the directory where your Excel files will be saved. It’s important to organize your files properly when working on multiple projects. Imagine this as your project’s filing cabinet!
## Step 2: Create HTML Data as a String
Next, we’ll define some basic HTML content. For the sake of this example, we’ll be using a simple HTML table. You can customize it according to your project’s needs.
```csharp
string sampleHtml = "<html><body><table><tr><td>This is sample text.</td><td>Some text.</td></tr><tr><td>This is another sample text.</td><td>Some text.</td></tr></table></body></html>";
```
We’re defining a very basic HTML string here. It contains a table with a couple of rows and columns. You can add more rows or columns as per your requirements. Think of it as preparing the ingredients before cooking a meal!
## Step 3: Load HTML String into MemoryStream
Now that we have our HTML content ready, the next step is to load it into memory using `MemoryStream`. This allows us to manipulate the HTML content in memory without saving it to disk first.
```csharp
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sampleHtml));
```
By converting the HTML string into a byte array and feeding it into a `MemoryStream`, we can work with the HTML data in memory. Imagine this step as preparing the dish in a pot before putting it in the oven!
## Step 4: Load the MemoryStream into a Workbook (Without Auto-Fitting)
Once we have the HTML content in memory, we load it into an Aspose `Workbook`. At this point, we are not auto-fitting the columns and rows just yet. This is our “before” scenario, to compare with the auto-fitted version later.
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(ms);
wb.Save(dataDir + "outputWithout_AutoFitColsAndRows.xlsx");
```
The workbook is loaded with the HTML content, but the columns and rows are not yet auto-fitted to the text. Think of this as baking a cake but forgetting to check the temperature—it works, but it might not be perfect!
## Step 5: Specify HTML Load Options with Auto-Fit Enabled
Now, here’s the magic! We create an instance of `HtmlLoadOptions` and enable the `AutoFitColsAndRows` property. This ensures that when the HTML content is loaded, the columns and rows adjust to fit the content inside them.
```csharp
HtmlLoadOptions opts = new HtmlLoadOptions();
opts.AutoFitColsAndRows = true;
```
By setting this option, we’re telling Aspose.Cells to automatically resize the rows and columns. Imagine this as setting the oven to the perfect temperature so that the cake rises just right!
## Step 6: Load HTML into Workbook with Auto-Fitting Enabled
Now we load the HTML content again, but this time with the `AutoFitColsAndRows` option enabled. This will adjust the column widths and row heights based on the content inside them.
```csharp
wb = new Workbook(ms, opts);
wb.Save(dataDir + "outputWith_AutoFitColsAndRows.xlsx");
```
This step loads the HTML content into a new workbook and saves it as an Excel file, but now the columns and rows are auto-fitted! Think of this as the perfectly baked cake, where everything is just the right size.
## Conclusion
By following these simple steps, you've learned how to load HTML content into a workbook using Aspose.Cells for .NET and auto-fit the columns and rows. This ensures your Excel sheets always look neat, no matter how dynamic the content is. It’s a simple yet powerful feature that can save you tons of time in formatting and organizing your Excel data.
Now that you’re equipped with this knowledge, you can experiment with more complex HTML content, add styling, and even create entire Excel workbooks from web pages!
## FAQ's
### Can I use this method to load large HTML tables?
Yes, Aspose.Cells handles large HTML tables efficiently, but for optimal performance, it's advisable to test with your data sizes.
### Can I apply specific column widths and row heights manually after auto-fitting?
