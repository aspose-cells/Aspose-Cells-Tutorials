# Display And Hide Scroll Bars Of Worksheet

## Introduction

Managing Excel files programmatically can often seem like magic! Whether you're looking to enhance the user experience or simplify the interface of your spreadsheet application, controlling visual components like scroll bars is essential. In this guide, we’ll explore how to display and hide the scroll bars of a worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. If you’re new to this or looking to refine your skills, you’re in the right place!

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, let's make sure you have everything you need:

1. Basic Knowledge of C#: A foundational understanding of C# programming will be helpful, as we’ll be writing code snippets in this language.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You'll need the Aspose.Cells library. You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. IDE Setup: An integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio or a code editor setup to write and execute C# code.
4. Excel File: A sample Excel file (e.g., `book1.xls`) that you can edit and test.

Once you have met these prerequisites, we can dive into the code.

## Importing Necessary Packages

To work with Aspose.Cells, you first need to import the required namespaces in your C# code. This is how you do it:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```

- `System.IO` allows you to manage file input and output operations.
- `Aspose.Cells` is the library that provides all the necessary functions to manipulate Excel files.

Now, let’s break down the task into digestible steps.

## Step 1: Define the File Path

This is where you specify the path to the Excel file you want to work with.


```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```
  
Replace `YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY` with the actual path where your Excel file is stored. This allows your program to find the necessary files it will manipulate.

## Step 2: Create a File Stream

Here, you create a file stream to read the Excel file.


```csharp
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(dataDir + "book1.xls", FileMode.Open);
```
  
The `FileStream` class enables you to read from and write to files. In this case, we’re opening our Excel file in read mode.

## Step 3: Instantiate a Workbook Object

Next, you need to create a `Workbook` object which represents your Excel file in the code.


```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);
```
  
This `Workbook` object now holds all the data and settings of your Excel file, allowing for manipulation later in the process.

## Step 4: Hide the Vertical Scroll Bar

Now comes the fun part! You can hide the vertical scroll bar to create a cleaner interface.


```csharp
workbook.Settings.IsVScrollBarVisible = false;
```
  
By setting `IsVScrollBarVisible` to `false`, the vertical scroll bar is hidden from view. This can be particularly useful when you want to limit scrolling in a user-friendly manner.

## Step 5: Hide the Horizontal Scroll Bar

Just like with the vertical scroll, you can also hide the horizontal scroll bar.


```csharp
workbook.Settings.IsHScrollBarVisible = false;
```
  
Here, we make the horizontal scroll bar invisible as well. This gives you greater control over the worksheet's appearance.

## Step 6: Save the Modified Excel File

After altering the visibility settings, you need to save your changes. 


```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
  
This code saves the modified workbook under a new name (`output.xls`). It prevents overwriting your original file, allowing you to maintain a backup.

## Step 7: Close the File Stream

Lastly, always remember to close your file streams to free up system resources.


```csharp
fstream.Close();
```
  
Closing the stream is a good practice to prevent memory leaks and keep your application running smoothly.

## Conclusion

By following these straightforward steps, you've learned how to display and hide the scroll bars of a worksheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This not only enhances the aesthetics of your Excel files but also improves the user experience, especially when presenting data or forms. 

## FAQ's

### Can I display the scroll bars again after hiding them?  
Yes! You just need to set `IsVScrollBarVisible` and `IsHScrollBarVisible` back to `true`.

### Is Aspose.Cells free to use?  
Aspose.Cells is not entirely free, but you can try it for free for a limited time or consider purchasing [a temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

### What types of Excel files can I manipulate with Aspose.Cells?  
You can work with various Excel formats, including .xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, .xlsb, etc.
