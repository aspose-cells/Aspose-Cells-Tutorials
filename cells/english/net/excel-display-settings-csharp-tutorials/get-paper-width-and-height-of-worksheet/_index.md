# Get Paper Width And Height Of Worksheet

## Introduction

Ever tried printing an Excel sheet and dealt with the confusing dimensions of various paper sizes? If you're like me, you know that nothing can spoil your day quite like a layout that doesn’t come out right! Whether you’re printing reports, invoices, or just a simple list, understanding how to adjust paper dimensions programmatically can save you a heap of trouble. Today, we're diving into the world of Aspose.Cells for .NET to examine how to retrieve and set paper sizes directly in your application. Let’s roll up our sleeves and get into the nitty-gritty of managing those paper dimensions!

## Prerequisites 

Before we get into the coding magic, let’s gather what you need to get started:

1. Basic Understanding of C#: You should have an introductory grasp of C#. If you’re new to programming, don’t worry! We’ll keep it straightforward.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.Cells library for .NET installed on your machine. You can download it from [this link](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. .NET Development Environment: Set up Visual Studio or any IDE of your choice to write and execute your C# code. If you're unsure about where to start, Visual Studio Community Edition is a solid choice.
4. References and Documentation: Familiarize yourself with Aspose.Cells documentation for deeper insights. You can find it [here](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/).
5. Basic Excel File Knowledge: Understanding how Excel files are structured (worksheets, rows, and columns) will go a long way.

Great! Now that we have the essentials checked off, let’s jump right into importing the necessary packages.

## Import Packages

To make our lives easier and leverage the full power of Aspose.Cells, we need to import a couple of packages. It’s as simple as adding a `using` statement at the top of your code file. Here’s what you need to import:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```

This line allows us to access all the classes and methods within the Aspose.Cells library, making it easier to manipulate Excel files. Now, let’s get into our step-by-step guide on retrieving the paper width and height for various paper sizes.

## Step 1: Create a New Workbook

The first step in working with Aspose.Cells is to create a new workbook. Think of a workbook as a blank canvas where you can add worksheets, cells, and, in our case, define paper sizes.

```csharp
//Create workbook
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```

This line instantiates a new workbook object, ready for us to manipulate. You won’t see anything just yet, but our canvas is set!

## Step 2: Access the First Worksheet

Now that we have our workbook, we need to access a specific worksheet within it. A worksheet is like a single page in your workbook, and it's where all the action happens.

```csharp
//Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

Here, we’re grabbing the first worksheet (index 0) from our workbook. You can think of it like flipping to the first page of a book. 

## Step 3: Set Paper Size and Get Dimensions

Now comes the exciting part! We’ll set different paper sizes and retrieve their dimensions one by one. This step is crucial as it allows us to see how different sizes affect the layout.

```csharp
//Set paper size to A2 and print paper width and height in inches
ws.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperA2;
Console.WriteLine("PaperA2: " + ws.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + ws.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```

In this block, we set the paper size to A2 and then retrieve its width and height. The `PaperWidth` and `PaperHeight` properties provide the dimensions in inches. It’s like checking the size of a frame before putting a picture in it.

## Step 4: Repeat for Other Paper Sizes

Let’s repeat the process for other common paper sizes. We’ll check A3, A4, and Letter sizes. This repetition is important for understanding how each size is defined within the Aspose.Cells framework.

```csharp
//Set paper size to A3 and print paper width and height in inches
ws.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperA3;
Console.WriteLine("PaperA3: " + ws.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + ws.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
//Set paper size to A4 and print paper width and height in inches
ws.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperA4;
Console.WriteLine("PaperA4: " + ws.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + ws.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
//Set paper size to Letter and print paper width and height in inches
ws.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSizeType.PaperLetter;
Console.WriteLine("PaperLetter: " + ws.PageSetup.PaperWidth + "x" + ws.PageSetup.PaperHeight);
```

Each of these blocks mimics the previous step but adjusts the `PaperSize` property accordingly. By merely changing the size indicator, you get different paper dimensions effortlessly. It’s like changing the size of a box based on what you need to store!

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these steps, you can easily set and retrieve the dimensions of various paper sizes in Aspose.Cells for .NET. This capability not only saves you time but also prevents printing mishaps that can occur due to misconfigured page settings. So, the next time you have to print an Excel sheet or create a report, you can do so with confidence, knowing you have the dimensions in your hands.
