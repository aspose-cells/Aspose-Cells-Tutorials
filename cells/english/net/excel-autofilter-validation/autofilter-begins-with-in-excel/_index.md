# Autofilter Begins With in Excel

## Introduction

When it comes to working with data, Excel has established itself as a go-to application for countless industries and purposes. One of its most powerful features is the AutoFilter, which makes sifting through extensive datasets a breeze. If you’re using Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can tap into this functionality programmatically and enhance your data management tasks significantly. In this guide, we're going to walk you through the process of implementing a feature that filters Excel rows based on whether they start with a certain string.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Development Environment: Familiarize yourself with a .NET development environment. This could be Visual Studio or any other IDE of your choice.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You need to have Aspose.Cells for .NET installed. If you haven't done this yet, you can conveniently download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A foundational understanding of C# and how to work with .NET libraries will help you follow along seamlessly.
4. Sample Data: You should have an Excel file, preferably named `sourseSampleCountryNames.xlsx`, located in your designated source directory. This file will contain the data we’ll be filtering.
5. Licensing: For full functionality, consider acquiring a license via this [link](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy). If you want to test the features, you can request a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

Got everything ready? Let's go!

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary namespaces at the top of your C# file:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```

This imports the core Aspose.Cells functionality alongside basic system features that we’ll rely on for console interaction.

Now that you have your environment set up and the necessary packages imported, let’s break down the Autofilter feature into manageable steps. We'll be implementing a filter that extracts rows beginning with "Ba".

## Step 1: Define Source and Output Directories

First up, let’s define where our input Excel file is located, as well as where we want to save our filtered output:

```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory\\";

// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory\\";
```

Explanation: Here, replace `"Your Document Directory\\"` with the actual path to your directories. Make sure to end the directory paths with a double backslash (`\\`) to avoid any path issues.

## Step 2: Instantiate the Workbook Object

Next, we’ll create a Workbook object that points to our Excel file:

```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object containing sample data
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sourseSampleCountryNames.xlsx");
```

Explanation: This line initializes a new Workbook instance using the specified file path. The `Workbook` class is fundamental as it represents the entire Excel file.

## Step 3: Accessing the First Worksheet

Now, we need to access the specific worksheet that we want to work with:

```csharp
// Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

Explanation: The `Worksheets` collection allows us to access individual sheets. Using `[0]` references the first worksheet in your Excel file, which is generally a common practice when working with a single-sheet file.

## Step 4: Setting Up the AutoFilter

Here’s where the magic begins! We’ll create an AutoFilter range for our data:

```csharp
// Creating AutoFilter by giving the cells range
worksheet.AutoFilter.Range = "A1:A18";
```

Explanation: The `AutoFilter.Range` property allows you to specify which rows to filter. In this case, we’re filtering rows within the range A1 to A18, which are assumed to hold our data.

## Step 5: Apply Filter Condition

The next step is to define the filter condition. We want to display only those rows whose first column values begin with "Ba":

```csharp
// Initialize filter for rows starting with string "Ba"
worksheet.AutoFilter.Custom(0, FilterOperatorType.BeginsWith, "Ba");
```

Explanation: The `Custom` method defines our filtering logic. The first argument (`0`) indicates we're filtering based on the first column (A), and the `FilterOperatorType.BeginsWith` specifies our condition to look for rows starting with "Ba".

## Step 6: Refresh the Filter

After applying our filter condition, we need to make sure Excel refreshes to reflect the changes:

```csharp
// Refresh the filter to show/hide filtered rows
worksheet.AutoFilter.Refresh();
```

Explanation: This line invokes a refresh on the AutoFilter to ensure that the visible rows correspond to the applied filter criteria. It’s similar to hitting the refresh button in Excel.

## Step 7: Save the Modified Excel File

Now it’s time to save the changes we’ve made:

```csharp
// Saving the modified Excel file
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outSourseSampleCountryNames.xlsx");
```

Explanation: The `Save` method writes the modified Workbook back to the specified output path. This falls under writing your defined filters into a new file so that your original data remains intact.

## Step 8: Output Confirmation

Finally, let’s confirm that our operation was successful:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("AutofilterBeginsWith executed successfully.\r\n");
```

Explanation: This simple line outputs a confirmation message to the console, letting you know that the filtering process was completed without errors.

## Conclusion

In a world where data management can feel overwhelming, mastering features like AutoFilter in Excel through Aspose.Cells for .NET empowers you to manipulate data efficiently and effectively. You've learned how to filter Excel rows that start with "Ba," implementing the method step by step. With practice, you'll be able to adapt this method for various data filtering needs in your ongoing projects.
