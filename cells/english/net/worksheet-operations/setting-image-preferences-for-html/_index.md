# Setting Image Preferences for HTML in .NET

## Introduction
Creating visually appealing web pages from Excel spreadsheets can enhance your online presentation of data. With Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can not only convert spreadsheets into HTML but also specify various settings to optimize images for the web. In this guide, we'll explore how to set image preferences when converting an Excel file to HTML. Ready to dive in? Let’s get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, make sure you have the following:

1. Visual Studio Installed: You’ll need a development environment like Visual Studio to run and test your .NET applications.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Cells. You can grab the latest version from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the examples better.
4. A sample Excel file: Prepare an Excel file named "Book1.xlsx" to work with. Place it in a designated folder that you’ll reference in your code.

## Import Packages

To leverage the capabilities of Aspose.Cells, you need to include the necessary library in your project. Here's how to do it:

### Open Your Project

Launch Visual Studio and open your existing C# project (or create a new one).

### Add Aspose.Cells Reference

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Choose “Manage NuGet Packages”.
3. Search for “Aspose.Cells” and install the package.

### Include Using Directive

At the top of your C# code file, include the Aspose.Cells namespace:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```

Now you're all set to utilize Aspose.Cells functionalities in your project!

Let’s break down the process of setting image preferences when exporting Excel to HTML using Aspose.Cells.

## Step 1: Specify the Document Directory

First, you need to set the path where your documents are stored. This is crucial for file access and management.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path on your machine.

## Step 2: Define the File Path

Next, specify the file path for the Excel document you want to convert.

```csharp
string filePath = dataDir + "Book1.xlsx";
```

Here, we concatenate the directory path with the filename to form a complete file path.

## Step 3: Load the Workbook

Now, it's time to load your Excel file into a Workbook object. This object will allow you to interact with the data in your spreadsheet.

```csharp
Workbook book = new Workbook(filePath);
```

With this line, Aspose.Cells reads your Excel file and prepares it for manipulation.

## Step 4: Create HtmlSaveOptions Instance

To customize how the conversion happens, you’ll need to create an instance of `HtmlSaveOptions`. This class lets you specify how you want your Excel data to be represented in HTML format.

```csharp
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Html);
```

By setting `SaveFormat.Html`, you indicate that your output format will be HTML.

## Step 5: Set Image Format to PNG

When converting images in your spreadsheet to HTML, you can specify the format of those images. In this example, we’ll set it to PNG, which is a widely-used image format for quality displays.

```csharp
saveOptions.ImageOptions.ImageType = Drawing.ImageType.Png;
```

Choosing PNG ensures that you retain the image quality during the conversion.

## Step 6: Configure Smoothing Mode

To enhance the appearance of the images, you can set the smoothing mode. Smoothing helps in reducing the jagged edges that might appear on the images.

```csharp
saveOptions.ImageOptions.SmoothingMode = System.Drawing.Drawing2D.SmoothingMode.AntiAlias;
```

By selecting `SmoothingMode.AntiAlias`, you make your images look smoother and more professional.

## Step 7: Optimize Text Rendering

Text rendering can also be optimized for a better visual experience. Set the text rendering hint to AntiAlias to achieve smoother text rendering.

```csharp
saveOptions.ImageOptions.TextRenderingHint = System.Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint.AntiAlias;
```

This little tweak can significantly enhance the readability of the text within your images.

## Step 8: Save the Workbook as HTML

Finally, it’s time to save your workbook as an HTML file using the options you've configured. This step is where the actual conversion happens.

```csharp
book.Save(dataDir + "output.html", saveOptions);
```

Here, the new HTML file will be saved in the same directory with the name `output.html`.

## Conclusion

By following this step-by-step guide, you've learned how to set image preferences for HTML exports using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This approach not only aids in creating a visually appealing representation of your Excel data but also optimizes it for web usage. Whether you're creating reports, dashboards, or simply visualizing data, these practical configurations can make a noteworthy difference!
