# Utilize Sheet_SheetId Property of OpenXml in Worksheet

## Introduction
In the world of data manipulation, Excel has been a longstanding companion. Whether you're crunching numbers, analyzing trends, or just organizing information, Excel is the go-to tool. But what about when you need to dig deeper into Excel files programmatically? That’s where Aspose.Cells for .NET shines! In this guide, we're going to walk through a neat feature of Aspose.Cells: utilizing the `Sheet_SheetId` property of OpenXml in a worksheet.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the juicy parts of the tutorial, let’s lay down some essentials:
1. Basic Knowledge of C#: You should be comfortable with C# programming to follow along closely.
2. Visual Studio Installed: If you don't have Visual Studio, you can grab it from the [site](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
3. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download and install it from the [releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). There’s a free trial available that you can use to test the waters!
4. OpenXml SDK: If you're planning to manipulate Excel files, having the OpenXml SDK in your toolkit is a good idea.
Now that we have our essentials checked off, let’s jump into the fun part – coding!
## Import Packages
Before we get our hands dirty, we need to import some essential packages. Open your C# project in Visual Studio and add the following using directives at the top of your file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
These packages will give us the functionality we need to work with Excel files, courtesy of Aspose.Cells.
Now, let's break this down into bite-sized pieces. We’re going to follow a simple workflow that involves loading an Excel file, accessing the first worksheet, and manipulating the sheet ID. Ready? Let’s go!
## Step 1: Define Source and Output Directories
First things first, we need to set the directories where our source Excel file is located and where we want to save our modified file.
```csharp
//Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
//Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replacing `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path on your system will help you keep your files organized.
## Step 2: Load the Source Excel File
Next, we need to load our Excel file into a `Workbook` object. This is where Aspose.Cells starts doing its magic.
```csharp
//Load source Excel file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleSheetId.xlsx");
```
Make sure you have a file named `sampleSheetId.xlsx` in your specified directory. If you don’t, simply create one or download a sample.
## Step 3: Access the First Worksheet
After loading the workbook, the next step is to access the first worksheet. We'll work with this sheet to modify its properties.
```csharp
//Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```
Here, we're grabbing the first worksheet (index 0). If you want to access a different worksheet, just change the index accordingly!
## Step 4: Print the Sheet ID
Let’s take a moment to check the current Sheet or Tab ID of our worksheet. This is vital for verification.
```csharp
//Print its Sheet or Tab Id on console
Console.WriteLine("Sheet or Tab Id: " + ws.TabId);
```
Running this will display the current Tab ID in your console. It’s like peeking at the ID tag of a guest at a party – super helpful!
## Step 5: Change the Sheet ID
Now comes the fun part! We’ll change the Tab ID to a new value. For this example, let’s set it to `358`:
```csharp
//Change Sheet or Tab Id
ws.TabId = 358;
```
This is where you can customize your workbook’s worksheets to fit your organizational needs.
## Step 6: Save the Workbook
After making your changes, don’t forget to save your workbook to ensure that all your hard work encapsulated in the code reflects in the Excel file.
```csharp
//Save the workbook
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputSheetId.xlsx");
```
Change `outputSheetId.xlsx` to whatever filename you wish, and make sure it's saved in your specified output directory.
## Step 7: Confirmation Message
Finally, let’s print a message to the console confirming that everything executed smoothly.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("UtilizeSheet_SheetId_PropertyOfOpenXml executed successfully.\r\n");
```
And there you have it! A simple yet effective way to manipulate the `Sheet_SheetId` property using Aspose.Cells for .NET.
