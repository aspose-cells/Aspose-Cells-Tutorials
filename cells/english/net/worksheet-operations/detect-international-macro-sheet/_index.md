# Detect International Macro Sheet in Workbook

## Introduction
Are you working with Excel files in .NET and need to identify whether a workbook contains an international macro sheet? If so, the Aspose.Cells library is exactly what you need! With its powerful features, you can efficiently manage and manipulate Excel files in your application. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to detect an international macro sheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the coding examples, there are a few prerequisites that you should have in place:
1. .NET Development Environment: Ensure you have a .NET environment set up, such as Visual Studio, where you can write and test your code.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: You must have the Aspose.Cells library installed in your project. You can easily obtain it from NuGet or download it directly from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Understanding of Excel: Familiarity with basic Excel concepts and terms will be beneficial.
4. Demo File: You should have an Excel file with an international macro sheet (like `.xlsm`) that you can use to test your code.
Let’s install the package and start coding!
## Import Packages
First, let's import the necessary packages to start working with the Aspose.Cells library. Here’s how you can do it:
### Importing Aspose.Cells
In your C# project, begin by including the namespace for Aspose.Cells at the top of your file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
This line allows you to use all the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.Cells library.

Now that you have set up your environment and imported the necessary packages, let’s walk through the step-by-step process to detect an international macro sheet in a workbook.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Source Directory
Now, let’s designate where your Excel file is stored. You’ll want to set the path to your document directory where your Excel file is located:
```csharp
//Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to the folder containing your `.xlsm` file. This makes sure that the application knows where to look for your Excel file.
## Step 2: Load the Excel Workbook
Next, you need to create a new `Workbook` object and load your Excel file into it. This is a crucial step because it allows your program to access the content of the file.
```csharp
//Load source Excel file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "InternationalMacroSheet.xlsm");
```
Here, we are instantiating a `Workbook` object with the path to the `.xlsm` file that includes the macro. This step reads the Excel file so that we can analyze its properties later.
## Step 3: Get the Sheet Type
To determine if the sheet in your workbook is an international macro sheet, we need to access the sheet type of the first worksheet in the workbook.
```csharp
//Get Sheet Type
SheetType sheetType = workbook.Worksheets[0].Type;
```
Using `workbook.Worksheets[0].Type`, we’re fetching the type of the first worksheet in the workbook. `Worksheets[0]` refers to the first sheet (index starts from 0), and `.Type` retrieves its type.
## Step 4: Print the Sheet Type
Finally, let’s print out the sheet type to the console. This will help us see whether the sheet is indeed an international macro sheet.
```csharp
//Print Sheet Type
Console.WriteLine("Sheet Type: " + sheetType);
```
By executing this line, the type of the sheet will be output to the console. It’s important to remember what these types mean – you’ll refer back to this information later on.
## Step 5: Confirm Execution Success
To wrap up, you can print a success message that confirms your function executed successfully.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("DetectInternationalMacroSheet executed successfully.");
```
This line is for confirmation – a friendly way to signal that everything went smoothly.
## Conclusion
Detecting an international macro sheet with Aspose.Cells for .NET is a straightforward process when you break it down step by step. With just a few lines of code, you can effectively analyze your Excel files and identify their types. This capability is especially crucial for developers working with financial data, reporting, and automation tasks where macros might play a significant role.
