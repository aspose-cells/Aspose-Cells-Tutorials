# Update Revision Log History in Shared Workbook

## Introduction
When it comes to managing Excel workbooks effectively, particularly in shared environments, keeping a solid revision log is crucial. Whether you're collaborating with team members or simply want to maintain a clear history of changes, using Aspose.Cells for .NET makes this task incredibly easy and efficient. If you're curious about how to update the revision log history in a shared workbook, you've landed on the right page. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process step by step, so you can enhance your Excel sheets and streamline collaboration.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the code and examples, there are a few prerequisites you'll need to have in place. Don't worry; they’re straightforward!
### .NET Development Environment
1. IDE Installation: Ensure you have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) installed where you can write and execute .NET code. Visual Studio is a great option for this.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: You'll need to download and include Aspose.Cells for .NET in your project. You can grab the latest version from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Familiarity with C#: Since we will be using C# in our examples, a basic understanding of the language will be quite helpful.
By completing these prerequisites, you will be all set to follow the tutorial.
## Import Packages
Now, for any .NET application to use Aspose.Cells, you need to import the necessary packages. This might seem a bit like setting up your toolbox before starting a DIY project.
### Create a New Project
- Open Visual Studio.
- Click on “Create a new project”.
- Choose “Console App (.NET Framework)” and give it a name, like `ExcelRevisionLogDemo`.
### Add the Aspose.Cells Library
- Go to the “Tools” menu and select “NuGet Package Manager”.
- Choose “Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...”.
- Search for `Aspose.Cells` and install it.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
Now that your project is set up, let's jump into the coding part!
## Step 1: Define Output Directory
This is where we’re going to save our shared workbook. You can think of it as setting up your workspace before you get started with the real work.
```csharp
// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Specify your directory path
```
Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where you want the file to be saved. 
## Step 2: Create an Empty Workbook
Next, we're going to create an empty workbook. It’s like laying a blank canvas before an artist.
```csharp
// Create an empty workbook
Workbook wb = new Workbook();
```
This line initializes a new instance of the workbook. 
## Step 3: Share the Workbook
Now, let’s make this workbook a shared one so others can work on it simultaneously. 
```csharp
// Share the workbook
wb.Settings.Shared = true;
```
By setting `Shared` to true, you allow multiple users to access and modify this workbook.
## Step 4: Update Days Preserving History of Revision Logs
Here’s where the magic happens! We’ll specify how long the revision logs should be preserved—7 days in this instance. Imagine setting a limit on how long a diary entry stays in an online blog. 
```csharp
// Update DaysPreservingHistory of RevisionLogs
wb.Worksheets.RevisionLogs.DaysPreservingHistory = 7;
```
This configuration ensures you keep track of changes for a week!
## Step 5: Save the Workbook
Finally, we’ll save our modified workbook. Think of this as hitting the “save” button after completing an important document.
```csharp
// Save the workbook
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputShared_DaysPreservingHistory.xlsx");
```
Make sure the combined path is correctly formatted; replace `outputDir` with the folder path you defined earlier.
## Step 6: Feedback on Execution
After saving, a simple console log can help confirm that everything went smoothly. 
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("UpdateDaysPreservingHistoryOfRevisionLogsInSharedWorkbook executed successfully.");
```
This line lets you know that the program has finished its task successfully. You can run your application now, and if all went well, you should see the output file in your specified directory!
## Conclusion
Updating the revision log history in shared workbooks using Aspose.Cells for .NET is a straightforward process. By following these steps, you not only enhance collaboration among team members but also keep track of changes effectively. Remember, the key to success with shared documents is maintaining an organized approach, and with this tutorial, you're well on your way!
