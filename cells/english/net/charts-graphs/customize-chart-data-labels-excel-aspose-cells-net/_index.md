string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Load source Excel file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(SourceDir + "/sampleSetShapeTypeOfDataLabelsOfChart.xlsx");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Shape Type of Data Labels (H2)

Customize data label shapes to enhance your chart visuals.

#### Step 1: Accessing the Chart and Series (H3)

Access the desired worksheet and chart:
```csharp
// Access the first worksheet in the workbook
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];

// Access the first chart in the worksheet
Chart ch = ws.Charts[0];
```

#### Step 2: Modifying Data Label Shape (H3)

Set the shape type of data labels to WedgeEllipseCallout:
```csharp
// Access the first series in the chart
Series srs = ch.NSeries[0];

// Set the shape type of data labels
srs.DataLabels.ShapeType = DataLabelShapeType.WedgeEllipseCallout;
```
The `DataLabelShapeType` parameter offers various shapes for enhancing visual storytelling.

#### Step 3: Saving Changes (H3)

Save your changes to a new file:
```csharp
// Save the modified Excel file
wb.Save(outputDir + "/outputSetShapeTypeOfDataLabelsOfChart.xlsx");
```
**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Verify paths and directory existence.
- Check file permissions when saving.
