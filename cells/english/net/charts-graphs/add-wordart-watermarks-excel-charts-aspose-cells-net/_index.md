#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Specify the Source Directory**: Define where your source Excel files are located.
    ```csharp
    string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
    ```
2. **Load the Workbook**:
   Load the workbook containing the Excel file you want to modify.
    ```csharp
    Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDir + "/sampleAddWordArtWatermarkToChart.xlsx");
    ```

### Access Chart in Worksheet

Access a chart located within the first worksheet of an Excel file.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Retrieve the First Chart**:
   Access the chart from the first worksheet.
    ```csharp

    ```

### Add WordArt Watermark to Chart

Add a WordArt watermark as a shape in the plot area of a chart.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Create the WordArt Shape**:
   Use the `AddTextEffectInChart` method to add WordArt.
    ```csharp
    Shape wordart = chart.Shapes.AddTextEffectInChart(

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Set Transparency**:
   Make the watermark semi-transparent for better visibility.
    ```csharp
    FillFormat wordArtFormat = wordart.Fill;
    wordArtFormat.Transparency = 0.9; // Set transparency to make it semi-transparent.
    ```
2. **Hide Border**:
   Remove any visible border around the WordArt shape.
    ```csharp
    LineFormat lineFormat = wordart.Line;
    lineFormat.Weight = 0.0; // Make the border invisible.
    ```
