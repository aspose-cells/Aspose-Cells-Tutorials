# How to Format Chart Series Values in Excel Using Aspose.Cells .NET

## Introduction

Do you need to programmatically format chart series values in Excel? This tutorial demonstrates using Aspose.Cells for .NET to set format codes for chart series. Whether automating report generation or standardizing financial presentations, controlling value formats can greatly improve data readability and consistency.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Installing and initializing Aspose.Cells for .NET
- Loading a workbook and accessing its components like worksheets and charts
- Adding series to a chart and setting their values format code
- Saving changes back to an Excel file

First, let's review the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Required Libraries:** Aspose.Cells for .NET compatible with your development environment.
- **Environment Setup:** A working .NET development setup (e.g., Visual Studio).
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# and familiarity with Excel file structures.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To use Aspose.Cells, add the library to your project as follows:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Package Manager:**
```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

### License Acquisition

Aspose offers a free trial license to evaluate the library's capabilities. For extended use, consider obtaining a temporary or permanent license:
- **Free Trial:** Download from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
- **Temporary License:** Request it [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase License:** Explore options [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

Once installed, initialize Aspose.Cells by creating a new `Workbook` instance.

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process into distinct steps for easier implementation.

### Load Workbook from Directory

**Overview:** Start by loading an Excel workbook from your specified directory.

```csharp
string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
// Load the source Excel file 
Workbook wb = new Workbook(SourceDir + "sampleSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx");
```

**Explanation:**
- `SourceDir` is the path to your input files.
- The `Workbook` constructor opens the specified file.

### Access Worksheet from Workbook

**Overview:** Retrieve the worksheet you need to work with.

```csharp
// Access first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

**Explanation:**
- Workbooks can contain multiple worksheets. Here, we access the first one using an index of `0`.

### Access Chart from Worksheet

**Overview:** Locate the chart within your selected worksheet to manipulate.

```csharp
// Access first chart
Chart ch = worksheet.Charts[0];
```

**Explanation:**
- Similar to worksheets, a worksheet can have multiple charts. This code accesses the first chart.

### Add Series to Chart

**Overview:** Add data series to your chart using an array of values.

```csharp
// Add series using an array of values
ch.NSeries.Add("{10000, 20000, 30000, 40000}", true);
```

**Explanation:**
- `NSeries.Add` takes a string representation of numbers and a boolean indicating whether the range is exclusive. Here, it's inclusive.

### Set Series Values Format Code

**Overview:** Customize how values in your chart series are formatted.

```csharp
// Access the series and set its values format code
Series srs = ch.NSeries[0];
srs.ValuesFormatCode = "$#,##0";
```

**Explanation:**
- `ValuesFormatCode` allows you to define a custom number format, like currency in this example (`"$#,##0"`).

### Save Workbook to Directory

**Overview:** Persist your changes by saving the workbook to an output directory.

```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
// Save the output Excel file
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx");
```

**Explanation:**
- The `Save` method writes the modified workbook to a new file, preserving your changes.

## Practical Applications

Here are some scenarios where this functionality is useful:
1. **Financial Reporting:** Automatically format currency values in charts for financial dashboards.
2. **Automated Data Analysis:** Standardize data presentation across multiple Excel reports generated from raw datasets.
3. **Educational Tools:** Create instructional materials with consistently formatted data visualizations.

## Performance Considerations

When using Aspose.Cells, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- **Efficient File Handling:** Minimize read/write operations by batching changes before saving.
- **Memory Management:** Dispose of `Workbook` objects appropriately to free memory.
- **Optimized Data Processing:** For large datasets, process data in chunks.

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to set format codes for chart series values using Aspose.Cells .NET. By following these steps, you can automate and standardize the presentation of data within Excel charts effectively. Next, consider exploring more advanced features like conditional formatting or integrating with other systems for comprehensive data solutions.
