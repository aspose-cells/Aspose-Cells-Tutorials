Setting up your source and output directories is crucial for file operations. This ensures that your application knows where to load files from and where to save results.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Define Directories**: Start by defining the paths for your source and output directories.
    ```csharp
    string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
    string OutputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
    ```

### Feature: Load Workbook from File

#### Overview
Loading an Excel workbook is the first step in accessing its contents. This feature demonstrates how to load a specific file using Aspose.Cells.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Specify Source Directory**: Ensure your source directory path is correctly set.
   ```csharp
   string SourceDirectory = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
   ```
2. **Create Workbook Object**: Load the workbook by specifying the path of an existing Excel file.
    ```csharp
    Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDirectory + "/sampleGetWorksheetOfTheChart.xlsx");
    ```

### Feature: Access Worksheet in Workbook

#### Overview
Accessing a specific worksheet within the workbook allows you to work with its data and components.

#### Implementation Steps
