**Overview**: This feature demonstrates how to create a new workbook, access its first worksheet, set the sheet name, and populate it with data.

1. **Create a New Workbook**
   
   ```csharp
   string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
   string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

   Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
   ```

2. **Access First Worksheet and Set Name**
   
   ```csharp
   Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
   sheet.Name = "Data";
   ```

3. **Populate Worksheet with Data**
