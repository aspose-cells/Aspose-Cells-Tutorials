## Prerequisites
Before diving into creating chart PDFs, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Required Libraries and Dependencies:** You will need to install Aspose.Cells for .NET.
- **Environment Setup Requirements:** A compatible .NET development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# and .NET programming.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET
### Installation
To incorporate Aspose.Cells into your project, use one of the following methods:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Package Manager:**
```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

### License Acquisition Steps
Aspose offers a free trial to explore their library's capabilities. You can obtain a temporary license or purchase a full version for extended use:

- **Free Trial:** Download the latest release from [Aspose's releases page](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
- **Temporary License:** Apply for a temporary license on the [Aspose website](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization
Once installed, initialize Aspose.Cells in your project by creating an instance of `Workbook` and accessing worksheets and charts:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;

// Load an Excel file
tWorkbook workbook = new Workbook("yourfile.xlsx");

// Access a worksheet and chart
tWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];	Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[0];
```

## Implementation Guide
### Creating Chart PDF with Custom Page Size
This section explains how to export your charts into a PDF format, specifying the page size as desired.

#### Step 1: Load Your Excel File
Load the sample Excel file containing the chart you wish to export:
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook("sampleCreateChartPDFWithDesiredPageSize.xlsx");
```

#### Step 2: Access Worksheet and Chart
Access the worksheet and chart from your workbook. Typically, you'll start by accessing the first worksheet and chart.
```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];	Chart ch = ws.Charts[0];
```

#### Step 3: Export Chart to PDF with Custom Page Size
Utilize the `ToPdf` method to export the chart into a PDF, specifying custom dimensions. Here, we set both width and height to 7 inches.
```csharp
ch.ToPdf("outputCreateChartPDFWithDesiredPageSize.pdf", 7, 7, 	PageLayoutAlignmentType.Center, PageLayoutAlignmentType.Center);
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- **File Path:** Destination of the output PDF.
- **Width and Height:** Dimensions in inches.
- **Page Layout Alignment Types:** Specify alignment settings for centering.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure you have appropriate permissions to read/write files.
- Verify that your Excel file contains at least one chart.
