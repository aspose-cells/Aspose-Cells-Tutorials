### Loading and Accessing the Workbook
Load your Excel file into a `Workbook` object:

string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Load the sample Excel file inside the workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDir + "/sampleDisableTextWrappingForDataLabels.xlsx");
```

### Accessing the Worksheet and Chart
Access the specific worksheet and chart you want to modify:
```csharp
// Access the first worksheet in the workbook
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

// Access the first chart in the worksheet
Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[0];
```

### Disabling Text Wrapping for Data Labels
Disable text wrapping by setting `IsTextWrapped` to false:
```csharp
foreach (var series in chart.NSeries)
{
    // Set IsTextWrapped to false to disable text wrapping
    series.DataLabels.IsTextWrapped = false;
}
```

### Saving the Modified Workbook
Save your changes by writing the modified workbook to a new file:
```csharp
// Save the workbook with changes to a new file
workbook.Save(outputDir + "/outputDisableTextWrappingForDataLabels.xlsx");
```
