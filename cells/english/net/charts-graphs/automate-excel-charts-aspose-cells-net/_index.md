## Implementation Guide

We'll cover key features with steps and code snippets to facilitate implementation.

### Feature 1: Load an Excel File

Load an existing Excel file using the `Workbook` class from Aspose.Cells.

**Step 1:** Define your source directory:
```csharp
string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
```

**Step 2:** Load the workbook:
```csharp
Workbook wb = new Workbook(SourceDir + "/sampleReadManipulateExcel2016Charts.xlsx");
```

### Feature 2: Access Worksheets and Charts

Access specific worksheets and their charts for manipulation.

**Step 1:** Access the first worksheet:
```csharp
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

**Step 2:** Iterate through all charts within this worksheet:
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < ws.Charts.Count; i++)
{
    Chart ch = ws.Charts[i];
}
```

### Feature 3: Read and Modify Chart Properties

Tailor your Excel charts by updating titles based on chart type.

**Step 1:** Iterate through each chart:
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < ws.Charts.Count; i++)
{
    Chart ch = ws.Charts[i];
```

**Step 2:** Update the title to include the chart type:
```csharp
string chartType = ch.Type.ToString();
ch.Title.Text = "Chart Type is " + chartType;
}
```

### Feature 4: Save Modified Workbook

Persist changes by saving your workbook.

**Step 1:** Define the output directory:
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

**Step 2:** Save the modified workbook:
```csharp
wb.Save(outputDir + "/outputReadManipulateExcel2016Charts.xlsx");
```

## Practical Applications

Automating chart manipulation can enhance productivity in various scenarios:
