## Implementation Guide

### Loading an Excel Workbook

#### Overview
Loading workbooks efficiently is the first step to manipulating data in Excel using Aspose.Cells.

#### Steps
1. **Set Source and Output Directories**: Define paths for your source Excel file and output location.
    ```csharp
    string SourceDir = "/path/to/source";
    string outputDir = "/path/to/output";
    ```
2. **Load the Workbook**: Create a `Workbook` instance by loading an existing Excel file.
    ```csharp
    Workbook workbook = new Workbook(SourceDir + "/sampleRichTextCustomDataLabel.xlsx");
    ```
3. **Save the Workbook**: Optionally, save to verify successful loading.
    ```csharp
    workbook.Save(outputDir + "/loadedWorkbook.xlsx");
    ```

### Accessing Worksheet and Chart

#### Overview
Access specific worksheets and charts within your workbook for further customizations.

#### Steps
1. **Load Workbook**: Ensure the workbook is already loaded as shown above.
2. **Access Worksheet**: Retrieve the first worksheet from the workbook.
    ```csharp
    Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
    ```
3. **Access Chart**: Get the first chart within the accessed worksheet.
    ```csharp
    Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[0];
    ```
4. **Save Modifications**: Save changes to confirm access to desired elements.
    ```csharp
    workbook.Save(outputDir + "/accessedChart.xlsx");
    ```

### Customizing Data Labels with Rich Text

    // Access data labels of the first series' point
    DataLabels dlbls = chart.NSeries[0].Points[0].DataLabels;
    
    // Set rich text label
    dlbls.Text = "Rich Text Label";
    
    // Customize font settings for initial characters
    FontSetting fntSetting = dlbls.Characters(0, 10);
    fntSetting.Font.Color = Color.Red; // Red color
    fntSetting.Font.IsBold = true;     // Bold text

    // Save the workbook with customized data labels
    workbook.Save(outputDir + "/outputRichTextCustomDataLabel.xlsx");
    ```
