## Implementation Guide

Now let's implement the feature to set print quality for an Excel worksheet using C#.

### Overview of Setting Print Quality

Adjusting the print quality of your worksheets ensures that printed documents meet professional standards, improving readability and presentation. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

#### Step 1: Instantiate a Workbook Object

Create an instance of the `Workbook` class to work with your Excel file.

```csharp
// Creating a new workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

#### Step 2: Access the Worksheet

Access the first worksheet in the workbook where you want to set print quality.

```csharp
// Accessing the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

#### Step 3: Set Print Quality

Set the desired print quality using the `PageSetup.PrintQuality` property. Here, we're setting it to 180 dpi.

```csharp
// Setting the print quality to 180 dpi
worksheet.PageSetup.PrintQuality = 180;
```

#### Step 4: Save the Workbook

Finally, save the workbook to apply changes and create an output file with the specified print settings.

```csharp
