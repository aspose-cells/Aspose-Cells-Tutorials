## Implementation Guide: Set Page Order in Excel with Aspose.Cells .NET

### Introduction to Page Setup Configuration

Configuring page order is crucial for specific print layouts, such as printing across multiple pages or setting custom sequences. This section demonstrates how to set the page order to "Over Then Down".

#### Step 1: Create and Configure Workbook

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;

namespace PageOrderExample
{
    public class SetPageOrder
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Define the directory for documents
            string dataDir = "YourDataDirectoryPathHere"; // Update this path

            // Create a new Workbook object
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

            // Access the PageSetup of the first worksheet
            PageSetup pageSetup = workbook.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
            
            // Set the printing order to Over Then Down
            pageSetup.Order = PrintOrderType.OverThenDown;

            // Save the modified workbook
            workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetPageOrder_out.xls");
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation of Key Components
- **Workbook Initialization**: Represents your Excel file.
- **PageSetup Access**: Used to modify printing settings on a worksheet level.
- **Print Order Configuration**: `PrintOrderType.OverThenDown` specifies that pages will be printed over and then down across sheets.

### Troubleshooting Tips

Common issues might include incorrect file paths or library not properly installed. Ensure your project references Aspose.Cells correctly, and verify the directory path for saving files.
