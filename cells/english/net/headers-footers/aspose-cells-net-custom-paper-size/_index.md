## Implementation Guide
### Setting a Custom Paper Size
With Aspose.Cells, you can customize your worksheet's paper size with ease. This section walks through implementing this feature in your .NET application.

#### Initializing Your Project
Start by creating an instance of the `Workbook` class and accessing its first worksheet:
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Cells;

string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Create workbook object
Workbook wb = new Workbook();

// Access first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

#### Configure Custom Paper Size
To set a custom paper size, use the `PageSetup.CustomPaperSize` method. Hereâ€™s how to specify dimensions in inches:
```csharp
// Set custom paper size (6 inches by 4 inches)
ws.PageSetup.CustomPaperSize(6, 4);
```
This feature is particularly useful for tailoring documents to fit unconventional print formats.

#### Populate and Save the Worksheet
Add content to your worksheet and save it as a PDF:
```csharp
// Access cell B4 on the worksheet
Cell b4 = ws.Cells["B4"];

// Add a message to cell B4 indicating the PDF page dimensions
b4.PutValue("Pdf Page Dimensions: 6.00 x 4.00 in");

// Save the workbook as a PDF file with custom paper size specified
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputCustomPaperSize.pdf");
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **PDF Rendering Issues**: Ensure your version of Aspose.Cells supports all features you need.
- **License Errors**: Double-check that your license is correctly applied, especially if migrating from a trial to a full license.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases for custom paper size settings:
1. **Custom Report Formats**: Tailor reports to fit specific business needs or regulatory requirements.
2. **Architectural Plans**: Fit large design blueprints onto standard-sized documents.
3. **Education Materials**: Create handouts with unique dimensions for better classroom integration.

These applications demonstrate the versatility of Aspose.Cells in various industries, from finance to education and beyond.
