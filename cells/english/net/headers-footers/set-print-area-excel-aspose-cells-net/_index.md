## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the process into manageable steps to set up a print area using Aspose.Cells .NET.

### Step 1: Initialize Workbook and Access PageSetup
#### Overview
Begin by creating an instance of the `Workbook` class, representing your Excel file. Then, access the `PageSetup` property of the desired worksheet.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;

namespace PrintAreaExample
{
    public class SetPrintArea
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            // Path to save the workbook
            string dataDir = RunExamples.GetDataDir(System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().DeclaringType);

            // Create a new Workbook instance
            Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

            // Access the first worksheet's PageSetup
            PageSetup pageSetup = workbook.Worksheets[0].PageSetup;
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Define and Set Print Area
#### Overview
Specify the print area by defining a range of cells to be printed using the `PrintArea` property.
```csharp
// Set the print area to include cells from A1 to T35
pageSetup.PrintArea = "A1:T35";
```

### Step 3: Save the Workbook
#### Overview
Save your workbook with the configured settings. This ensures only the specified range is considered when printing or exporting.
```csharp
// Save the modified workbook to a new file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "SetPrintArea_out.xls");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** Ensure project references are correctly set up and there's no version conflict with Aspose.Cells.
