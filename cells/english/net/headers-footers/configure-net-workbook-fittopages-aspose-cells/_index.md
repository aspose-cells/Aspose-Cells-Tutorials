## Implementation Guide

### Setting Workbook and Worksheet Access

This feature allows you to create a new workbook and access its first worksheet.

**Overview**
You'll learn how to instantiate a `Workbook` object and retrieve the default worksheet, setting the stage for further configuration.

#### Initialize Workbook and Access Worksheet
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Create a new instance of Workbook

// Access the first worksheet in the workbook
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

### Configuring FitToPages Options for Worksheet

Adjusting FitToPages options ensures your worksheet fits neatly on specified pages.

**Overview**
Here, we'll configure how many pages tall and wide a worksheet should span when printed.

#### Set FitToPagesOptions
```csharp
// Set the number of vertical pages to fit the worksheet content
worksheet.PageSetup.FitToPagesTall = 1;

// Set the number of horizontal pages for the worksheet content
worksheet.PageSetup.FitToPagesWide = 1;
```

### Saving Workbook

Finally, save your configured workbook to a specified directory.

**Overview**
Learn how to preserve your adjustments by saving the workbook with a desired filename.

#### Save Configured Workbook
