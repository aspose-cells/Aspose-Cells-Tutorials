# How to Add Watermarks in Excel Using Aspose.Cells .NET

In today's digital world, protecting your sensitive data is crucial when sharing documents like spreadsheets. Adding watermarks—a subtle yet powerful visual cue—can indicate confidentiality or ownership. This comprehensive guide walks you through using Aspose.Cells for .NET to add and customize watermark text effects in Excel sheets.

## What You'll Learn
- Setting up Aspose.Cells for .NET in your development environment.
- Adding a watermark to an Excel sheet with C#.
- Customizing the appearance of watermarks, including color and transparency settings.
- Locking shapes within Excel to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Practical applications for enhancing document security.

Let's explore how you can implement these functionalities in your projects.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have:
- **Visual Studio** installed on your machine (any version from 2017 onwards).
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET development.
- A general understanding of Excel file manipulation using APIs.

Additionally, install Aspose.Cells for .NET via NuGet Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI:

**NuGet Package Manager**
```bash
PM> Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

### License Acquisition
To use Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can start with a free trial license to explore its capabilities:
1. **Free Trial:** Visit the [Aspose temporary license page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) and request a temporary license.
2. **Purchase:** For long-term usage, purchase a license through [Aspose Purchase Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Setup
Once you've acquired Aspose.Cells via NuGet or the CLI, initialize it in your C# project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
```

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET
Here's a brief overview of setting up and initializing Aspose.Cells:
1. **Install** Aspose.Cells using either the Package Manager Console or .NET CLI as shown above.
2. **Initialize:** Begin by creating a `Workbook` object, representing an Excel file.

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
3. **Apply License:** If you have a license, apply it to unlock full features.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Add Watermark to Excel Sheet
#### Overview
Adding a watermark involves creating text effects that overlay your data subtly, signaling document status like "CONFIDENTIAL."

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Create a Workbook and Worksheet
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

##### Add Text Effect as Watermark
Create the text effect shape with specific attributes such as font style, size, position, and appearance.

```csharp
Shape wordart = sheet.Shapes.AddTextEffect(
    MsoPresetTextEffect.TextEffect1,
    "CONFIDENTIAL", 
    "Arial Black",
    50,   // Font size
    false, // Is italic
    true, // Is bold
    18,   // Left position
    8,    // Top position
    1,    // Width
    1,    // Height
    130,  // Rotation angle
    800   // Scale factor
);
```

##### Customize Appearance
Set the gradient color and transparency for a polished look.
```csharp
FillFormat wordArtFormat = wordart.Fill;
wordArtFormat.SetOneColorGradient(Color.Red, 0.2, GradientStyleType.Horizontal, 2); 
wordArtFormat.Transparency = 0.9; // Make it slightly transparent

wordart.HasLine = false; // Remove the border line for a cleaner appearance
```

##### Save Your Workbook
```csharp
workbook.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\output_out.xlsx");
```

### Feature 2: Lock Shape Aspects in Excel Sheet
#### Overview
Locking shapes prevents unauthorized users from altering the watermark or other shapes, ensuring document integrity.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Lock Various Properties of the Watermark
Secure your watermark by locking its aspects.
```csharp
wordart.IsLocked = true;
wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.Selection, true);
wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.ShapeType, true);
wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.Move, true);
wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.Resize, true);
wordart.SetLockedProperty(ShapeLockType.Text, true);
```

##### Save Changes
Ensure the changes are saved to your workbook.
```csharp
workbook.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\output_out.xlsx");
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Confidential Reports:** Use watermarks for internal reports containing sensitive information.
2. **Copyright Notices:** Embed copyright notices in templates distributed to clients.
3. **Version Control:** Indicate draft or final versions of documents with relevant watermark text.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Resources:** Minimize resource usage by only loading necessary worksheets and shapes.
- **Memory Management:** Dispose of objects properly using `Dispose()` methods where applicable, ensuring efficient memory management in .NET applications.

## Conclusion
By mastering the use of Aspose.Cells for .NET to add watermarks and lock shapes within Excel sheets, you enhance document security and convey critical information at a glance. This guide has equipped you with the necessary skills to implement these features effectively.

### Next Steps
Explore further customization options in the [Aspose.Cells documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/cells/net/) or try integrating these functionalities into larger systems requiring robust document management.

2. **Can I use different fonts for my watermark?**
   - Yes, specify any font by changing the third parameter in `AddTextEffect()`.
3. **What if my Excel file is large and loading is slow?**
   - Consider optimizing your code to load only necessary parts of the workbook or using performance tuning options available in Aspose.Cells.
4. **Is it possible to remove a watermark later?**
   - Yes, you can delete shapes from the worksheet collection where they reside.
5. **How do I apply this solution in batch processing?**
