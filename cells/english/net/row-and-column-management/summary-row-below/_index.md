# Create Summary Row Below with Aspose.Cells for .NET

## Introduction
Are you ready to take your Excel skills to the next level? If you’ve ever found yourself wrestling with large datasets in Excel, you know how overwhelming it can get. Luckily, Aspose.Cells for .NET is here to save the day! In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to create a summary row below a group of rows in an Excel sheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will walk you through each step with ease. Let’s dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the coding, let’s make sure you have everything you need:
1. Visual Studio: You’ll need an IDE to work with. Visual Studio is a popular choice for .NET development.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). Make sure you have a license or a temporary license, which you can obtain [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A little familiarity with C# will help you understand the examples better. Don’t worry if you’re not an expert; we’ll explain everything as we go along!
## Import Packages
To get started with Aspose.Cells, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Here's how to do it:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
This line allows you to access the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.Cells library. It’s like opening the toolbox to get the right tools for the job. 
Now that we have our prerequisites sorted out and the necessary packages imported, let’s walk through the process of creating a summary row below the grouped rows in your Excel worksheet. We'll break this down into simple steps to make it easy to follow.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
First things first, let’s set up our development environment. Make sure you have a new project in Visual Studio and have added a reference to the Aspose.Cells library.
1. Create a New Project: Open Visual Studio, click on "Create a new project," and select a Console Application.
2. Add Aspose.Cells Reference: Right-click on the "References" in your project and choose "Add Reference." Browse to the location of the Aspose.Cells DLL you downloaded and add it.
## Step 2: Initialize Workbook and Worksheet
Next, we’ll initialize the workbook and worksheet that we’ll be working with. This is where you’ll load your Excel file and get ready to manipulate it.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory"; // Set your document directory
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "sample.xlsx"); // Load your Excel file
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0]; // Get the first worksheet
```
- `dataDir`: This is the path where your Excel file is located. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path on your machine.
- `Workbook`: This class represents an Excel workbook. We’re loading `sample.xlsx`, which should be in your specified directory.
- `Worksheet`: This line fetches the first worksheet in the workbook. If you have multiple sheets, you can access them by index.
## Step 3: Group Rows and Columns
Now it’s time to group the rows and columns that you want to summarize. This feature allows you to collapse and expand data easily, making your worksheet much cleaner.
```csharp
// Grouping first six rows and first three columns
worksheet.Cells.GroupRows(0, 5, true);
worksheet.Cells.GroupColumns(0, 2, true);
```
- `GroupRows(0, 5, true)`: This groups the first six rows (from index 0 to 5). The `true` parameter indicates that the grouping should be collapsed by default.
- `GroupColumns(0, 2, true)`: Similarly, this groups the first three columns.
## Step 4: Set the Summary Row Below Property
With the rows and columns grouped, we now need to set the property that determines where the summary row appears. In our case, we want it to appear above the grouped rows.
```csharp
// Setting SummaryRowBelow property to false
worksheet.Outline.SummaryRowBelow = false;
```
- `SummaryRowBelow`: By setting this property to `false`, we specify that the summary row will be positioned above the grouped rows. If you wanted it below, you would set this to `true`.
## Step 5: Save the Modified Excel File
Finally, after making all these changes, it’s time to save the modified workbook. This step is crucial because if you don’t save your work, all your efforts will go to waste!
```csharp
// Saving the modified Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
- `Save`: This method saves the workbook to the specified path. We’re saving it as `output.xls`, but you can name it whatever you like.
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve just created a summary row below grouped rows in an Excel sheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This powerful library makes it super easy to manipulate Excel files programmatically, saving you tons of time and effort. Whether you're managing data for business or simply trying to keep your personal spreadsheets organized, this technique can come in handy.
