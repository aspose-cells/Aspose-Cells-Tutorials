# Create Summary Row Right with Aspose.Cells for .NET

## Introduction
If you’ve ever worked with Excel, you know how handy it is to organize your data. Imagine being able to group rows and columns to keep your spreadsheet neat and tidy. In this tutorial, we're going to dive into how to create a summary row on the right side of your grouped data using Aspose.Cells for .NET. Whether you’re a developer looking to enhance your Excel automation or someone who just wants to streamline their data presentation, this guide is for you. Let’s get started and unlock the power of Aspose.Cells to make your Excel tasks a breeze!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the coding part, here’s what you need to have:
1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. It’s a powerful IDE that makes working with .NET projects much easier.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). If you want to test it out first, check out the [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A little familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the examples better. Don’t worry if you’re not an expert; we’ll guide you through the code step by step!
## Import Packages
Before we can start coding, we need to import the necessary packages in our C# project. Here’s how to do it:
### Create a New Project
1. Open Visual Studio and create a new project.
2. Choose Console App (.NET Framework) from the available templates and give your project a name.
### Install Aspose.Cells
You can install Aspose.Cells using NuGet Package Manager. Here’s how:
- Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
- Select Manage NuGet Packages.
- In the Browse tab, search for `Aspose.Cells`.
- Click Install.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
Once you have everything set up, we’re ready to write some code!
Now, let’s break down the process into detailed steps. We’ll go through everything from loading an Excel file to saving the modified file.
## Step 1: Define the File Path
First, we need to set the path to our Excel file. Here’s how to do it:
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where your Excel file is stored. This is where our `sample.xlsx` file will be located.
## Step 2: Load the Workbook
Next, we’ll load the workbook (Excel file) that we want to work with:
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "sample.xlsx");
```
This line creates a new `Workbook` object, allowing us to manipulate the Excel file programmatically. Make sure that `sample.xlsx` exists in the specified directory, or else you’ll run into an error.
## Step 3: Access the Worksheet
Once we have the workbook, we need to access the specific worksheet we want to modify. For simplicity, we’ll work with the first worksheet:
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
## Step 4: Group Rows
Now it’s time to group the first six rows together. Grouping rows allows us to collapse or expand them easily:
```csharp
worksheet.Cells.GroupRows(0, 5, true);
```
Here, we’re grouping rows 0 through 5 (the first six rows). The `true` parameter indicates that we want to collapse these rows by default.
## Step 5: Group Columns
Just like rows, we can also group columns. We’ll group the first three columns in this step:
```csharp
worksheet.Cells.GroupColumns(0, 2, true);
```
This code will group columns 0 through 2 (the first three columns) and also collapse them by default.
## Step 6: Set the Summary Column Position
Now that we’ve grouped our rows and columns, let’s specify that we want the summary column to appear on the right:
```csharp
worksheet.Outline.SummaryColumnRight = true;
```
This simple line of code is what makes our summary row appear on the right side of our grouped columns.
## Step 7: Save the Modified Excel File
After making all the changes, we need to save our workbook. Here’s how you can do that:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
This code saves the modified workbook as `output.xls` in the specified directory. Make sure to check this file to see your changes!
## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully created a summary row on the right side of your grouped data in an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This method not only helps keep your data organized but also makes it visually appealing and easier to interpret. Whether you're summarizing sales figures, academic results, or any other dataset, this technique will surely come in handy.
