# How to Generate Excel Reports Using Aspose.Cells .NET with Smart Markers

## Introduction

Are you looking to generate dynamic Excel reports in your .NET applications? With Aspose.Cells for .NET, creating professional-looking spreadsheets becomes straightforward using smart markers. This feature simplifies data binding and formatting. Follow this tutorial to create comprehensive reports by defining classes, setting up smart markers, and configuring an Excel workbook.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Defining custom classes in C#.
- Integrating Aspose.Cells for .NET into your project.
- Using Smart Markers to efficiently populate data in Excel sheets.
- Programmatically styling and formatting Excel reports.

Let's review the prerequisites before we begin.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:
- A development environment with Visual Studio or any compatible IDE supporting .NET applications.
- Basic understanding of C# and object-oriented programming concepts.
- The Aspose.Cells for .NET library. Install it using the NuGet Package Manager.

### Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

First, add the Aspose.Cells package to your project:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

Aspose offers a free trial, but for extended use and additional features, consider obtaining a temporary license or purchasing one. Visit [Aspose's purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) to explore licensing options.

## Implementation Guide

This section guides you through implementing each feature in logical steps.

### Define Person Class
#### Overview
We begin by defining the `Person` class, which acts as our data model. This class includes properties for a person's name and age.
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Person
{
    private int _age;
    private string _name;

    public int Age
    {
        get { return _age; }
        set { _age = value; }
    }

    public string Name
    {
        get { return _name; }
        set { _name = value; }
    }

    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        _age = age;
        _name = name;
    }
}
```
### Define Teacher Class
#### Overview
Next, we extend the `Person` class to create a `Teacher` class. This class holds additional information about students associated with each teacher.
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Teacher : Person
{
    private IList<Person> m_students;

    public Teacher(string name, int age) : base(name, age)
    {
        m_students = new List<Person>();
    }

    public IList<Person> Students
    {
        get { return m_students; }
        set { m_students = value; }
    }
}
```
### Initialize and Configure Workbook with SmartMarkers
#### Overview
This feature demonstrates setting up an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells to use smart markers, allowing you to define templates in your worksheets for automatic data population.
```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;

class WorkbookSetup
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
        string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

        // Create a new workbook instance and access the first worksheet
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
        Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

        // Populate headers with smart markers
        worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue("Teacher Name");
        worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue("&=Teacher.Name");

        worksheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue("Teacher Age");
        worksheet.Cells["B2"].PutValue("&=Teacher.Age");

        worksheet.Cells["C1"].PutValue("Student Name");
        worksheet.Cells["C2"].PutValue("&=Teacher.Students.Name");

        worksheet.Cells["D1"].PutValue("Student Age");
        worksheet.Cells["D2"].PutValue("&=Teacher.Students.Age");

        // Apply style to headers
        Range range = worksheet.Cells.CreateRange("A1:D1");
        Style style = workbook.CreateStyle();
        style.Font.IsBold = true;
        style.ForegroundColor = Color.Yellow;
        style.Pattern = BackgroundType.Solid;
        StyleFlag flag = new StyleFlag { All = true };
        range.ApplyStyle(style, flag);

        // Prepare data for smart markers
        WorkbookDesigner designer = new WorkbookDesigner();
        designer.Workbook = workbook;

        List<Teacher> list = new List<Teacher>();

        Teacher h1 = new Teacher("Mark John", 30);
        h1.Students.Add(new Person("Chen Zhao", 14));
        h1.Students.Add(new Person("Jamima Winfrey", 18));
        h1.Students.Add(new Person("Reham Smith", 15));

        Teacher h2 = new Teacher("Masood Shankar", 40);
        h2.Students.Add(new Person("Karishma Jathool", 16));
        h2.Students.Add(new Person("Angela Rose", 13));
        h2.Students.Add(new Person("Hina Khanna", 15));

        list.Add(h1);
        list.Add(h2);

        // Set data source and process smart markers
        designer.SetDataSource("Teacher", list);
        designer.Process();

        // Autofit columns for readability
        worksheet.AutoFitColumns();

        // Save the workbook to an output file
        string outputPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputDir, "output.xlsx");
        designer.Workbook.Save(outputPath);
    }
}
```
