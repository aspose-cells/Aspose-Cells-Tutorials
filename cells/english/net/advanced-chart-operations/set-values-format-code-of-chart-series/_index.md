# Set Values Format Code of Chart Series

## Introduction

In today’s data-driven world, visual representation of complex datasets is crucial for decision-making. Charts serve as a powerful tool to communicate insights effectively. Aspose.Cells for .NET simplifies this process, allowing developers to effortlessly manipulate Excel files and create stunning charts. In this guide, we’ll explore how to set the values format code of chart series using Aspose.Cells. So, grab a cup of coffee, and let’s embark on this coding journey together!

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the nitty-gritty, let's make sure you're set up for success. Here’s what you need:

1. Basic understanding of C#: Familiarity with C# will help you grasp the programming concepts easily.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You'll need the Aspose.Cells library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Visual Studio: A suitable IDE for writing and executing your C# code. Any version that supports .NET will do.
4. Excel file: For our demonstration, we will use an Excel file named `sampleSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx`. Ensure you have it ready in your working directory.

## Import Packages

First things first, let’s import the necessary packages. This step is crucial as it allows us to leverage the functionalities provided by Aspose.Cells.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;

using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
```

With these imports, we can now access the essential classes from the Aspose library that we need for manipulating Excel files.

Now, let's break down the process into simple, digestible steps. Follow along as we outline how to set the values format code of chart series in your Excel files.

## Step 1: Setup Source and Output Directories

Before we can manipulate our Excel file, we need to specify where it's located and where the output should go. 

Think of this as setting the stage for our performance. If you don’t know where your inputs are and where you want your outputs, your program will get lost in the maze of file directories!

```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory";
```

## Step 2: Load the Source Excel File

Now that we've set our directories, it's time to load the Excel file we want to work with.

Loading the Excel file is akin to opening a book before reading. Without opening it, you can’t dive into its contents. 

```csharp
// Load the source Excel file 
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx");
```

## Step 3: Access the Worksheet

Once we have our workbook loaded, let's dive into the first worksheet.

Each worksheet in an Excel file acts like a page in a book. You want to access the correct page to find the data you're interested in!

```csharp
// Access first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

## Step 4: Access the Chart

Next, we need to access the chart where we wish to modify the series format.

Imagine the chart as a canvas where your data visualization masterpiece is painted. Accessing it lets us harness its power!

```csharp
// Access first chart
Chart ch = worksheet.Charts[0];
```

## Step 5: Add Data Series

With the chart ready, let’s add some data series to visualize.

Adding a series is like adding colors to your painting. The more colorful, the more engaging the artwork!

```csharp
// Add series using an array of values
ch.NSeries.Add("{10000, 20000, 30000, 40000}", true);
```

## Step 6: Set the Values Format Code

This is where the magic happens. We’ll set the format code for the newly added series.

Setting the format code transforms the raw numbers into something more readable, just like applying a filter to enhance your photo before showing it to the world!

```csharp
// Access the series and set its values format code
Series srs = ch.NSeries[0];
srs.ValuesFormatCode = "$#,##0"; // This sets it to currency format
```

## Step 7: Save the Output Excel File

Finally, we need to save the changes we've made to a new Excel file.

Saving your hard work feels rewarding, doesn’t it? It preserves your efforts and allows you to share or review your work anytime!

```csharp
// Save the output Excel file
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputSeries_ValuesFormatCode.xlsx");
```

## Step 8: Confirmation Message

To wrap everything up, we can print out a success message.

Just like receiving applause at the end of a performance, this confirmation gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling of accomplishment.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("SetValuesFormatCodeOfChartSeries executed successfully.");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we’ve journeyed through the process of setting the values format code of a chart series using Aspose.Cells for .NET. From loading our Excel file to saving the final product, each step brings us closer to effectively visualizing data in a way that’s both meaningful and impactful. Now, you can take these skills and apply them to your ongoing projects.
