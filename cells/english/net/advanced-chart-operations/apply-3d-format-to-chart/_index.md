# Apply 3D Format to Chart

## Introduction

In an age where data visualization is paramount, the way we present our data goes beyond basic graphs and charts. With tools like Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can elevate your data presentations with stunning 3D charts that not only grab attention but also convey information effectively. This guide will walk you through the steps to apply a 3D format to a chart using Aspose.Cells, transforming your raw data into an engaging display.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of applying a 3D format to a chart, let’s ensure you have everything you need.

### Software Requirements

- Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed to work with .NET applications.
- Aspose.Cells for .NET: If you haven't yet, download and install Aspose.Cells from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).

### Coding Environment Setup

1. Create a new .NET Project: Open Visual Studio, select “Create a new project,” and choose a Console Application.
2. Add Aspose.Cells Reference: Via NuGet Package Manager, add Aspose.Cells by searching for it or via the Package Manager Console:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

3. Setup Output Directory: Designate an output directory where your generated files will be saved—this can be as simple as creating a folder on your desktop.

Now that you’re all set up, it’s time to jump into the code and create some dazzling 3D charts!

## Import Packages

To start, you need to import the necessary namespaces. This will help you access the classes and methods provided by Aspose.Cells. Here’s how you do that:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Drawing;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
```

This section will break down the process into manageable steps, providing you with a clear understanding of each stage.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Workbook

First, you need to create an instance of the `Workbook` class. This object will serve as the foundation for your Excel document.

```csharp
//Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
Workbook book = new Workbook();
```
Think of this `Workbook` as a blank canvas—ready for you to fill it with colorful data and impactful visualizations.

## Step 2: Rename the First Worksheet

Next, let’s rename the first worksheet. This provides clarity on what data we are working with.

```csharp
book.Worksheets[0].Name = "DataSheet";
```

Names should be intuitive. In this case, we're naming it "DataSheet" so we know where our data lives.

## Step 3: Create Data for the Chart

Now, we’ll add some data to our "DataSheet." Let's populate it with values that our chart will use.

```csharp
Worksheet dataSheet = book.Worksheets["DataSheet"];
dataSheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue(1);
dataSheet.Cells["B2"].PutValue(2);
dataSheet.Cells["B3"].PutValue(3);
dataSheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue("A");
dataSheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue("B");
dataSheet.Cells["A3"].PutValue("C");
```

Just like a recipe depends on ingredients, your chart's effectiveness relies on the quality and organization of your input data.

## Step 4: Setup a New Chart Worksheet

Time to create a new worksheet for the chart itself. This helps keep your data visualization organized.

```csharp
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets.Add("MyChart");
```

Consider this worksheet as your stage—where the performance of your data unfolds.

## Step 5: Add a Chart

Here, we will add a column chart to the newly created worksheet.  

```csharp
ChartCollection charts = sheet.Charts;
int chartSheetIdx = charts.Add(ChartType.Column, 5, 0, 25, 15);
```

We’re defining a space for our chart and specifying what type it is. Just think of it as selecting the type of frame for your artwork.

## Step 6: Customize Chart Appearance

Now, let’s customize our chart's look by setting background colors. 

```csharp
Aspose.Cells.Charts.Chart chart = book.Worksheets["MyChart"].Charts[0];
chart.PlotArea.Area.BackgroundColor = Color.White;
chart.ChartArea.Area.BackgroundColor = Color.White;
chart.PlotArea.Area.ForegroundColor = Color.White;
chart.ChartArea.Area.ForegroundColor = Color.White;
chart.ShowLegend = false;
```

A clean white background often makes the colors of your data stand out, enhancing visibility.

## Step 7: Add Data Series to the Chart

It’s time to feed our chart the data. We’ll add a data series from our "DataSheet" to ensure our chart reflects the data we need.

```csharp
chart.NSeries.Add("DataSheet!B1:B3", true);
chart.NSeries.CategoryData = "DataSheet!A1:A3";
```

This is analogous to a chef preparing a dish with specific ingredients. Each data point matters!

## Step 8: Access and Format the Data Series

Now that we have our data linked, let’s grab the data series and start applying some 3D effects.

```csharp
Aspose.Cells.Charts.Series ser = chart.NSeries[0];
ShapePropertyCollection spPr = ser.ShapeProperties;
Format3D fmt3d = spPr.Format3D;
```

We’re getting ready to add some flair to our dish—think of it as seasoning that enhances the overall flavor.

## Step 9: Apply 3D Bevel Effects

Next, we will add a bevel effect to give our chart some dimension.

```csharp
Bevel bevel = fmt3d.TopBevel;
bevel.Type = BevelPresetType.Circle;
bevel.Height = 2;
bevel.Width = 5;
```

Just like a sculptor shapes stone, we’re creating depth that makes our chart come alive!

## Step 10: Customize Surface Material and Lighting

Let’s make our chart shine bright! We’ll adjust the surface material and lighting settings.

```csharp
fmt3d.SurfaceMaterialType = PresetMaterialType.WarmMatte;
fmt3d.SurfaceLightingType = LightRigType.ThreePoint;
fmt3d.LightingAngle = 20;
```

Proper lighting and material can transform a flat object into a captivating visual. Think of a movie set expertly lit to enhance every scene.

## Step 11: Final Touches on the Series Appearance

Now to finalize the look of our data series by adjusting its color.

```csharp
ser.Area.BackgroundColor = Color.Maroon;
ser.Area.ForegroundColor = Color.Maroon;
ser.Border.Color = Color.Maroon;
```

The right color can evoke certain feelings and reactions—maroon adds a touch of elegance and sophistication.

## Step 12: Save Your Workbook

Finally, it’s time to save your masterpiece! Don’t forget to specify the destination where you want to store it.

```csharp
book.Save(outputDir + "outputApplying3DFormat.xlsx");
Console.WriteLine("Applying3DFormat executed successfully.");
```

Saving your work is like putting your art in a gallery; it’s a moment to cherish and share.
