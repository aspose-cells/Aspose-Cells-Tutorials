# Detect File Format of Encrypted Files in .NET

## Introduction
When you're working with file formats, you might often find yourself needing to identify the format of files that are encrypted. This guide will walk you through how to detect the file format of encrypted files in .NET using the powerful Aspose.Cells library. In those moments where you’re unsure about a file's format, don’t you wish there was a quick and easy way to uncover that? Well, Aspose.Cells has your back! Let’s dive into it.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:
1. Visual Studio Installed: Ensure you have Visual Studio or another .NET development environment set up.
2. .NET Framework: Make sure you are targeting a compatible .NET framework (at least .NET Core or .NET Framework).
3. Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Cells library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
4. Basic Understanding of C#: A fundamental grasp of C# programming will make this process smoother.
Now that we have the groundwork laid, let’s import the necessary packages to get started with the code.
## Import Packages
In your C# project, you will need to import the following packages. This will enable you to use all the relevant functionalities of the Aspose.Cells library:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System;
```
Make sure to add these imports at the top of your C# file to ensure everything runs smoothly.
Now, let’s break this down step by step. We will navigate through creating a simple program that detects the file format of an encrypted Excel file. Each step will be broken down so that it is clear and easy to follow.
## Step 1: Set Up Your File Directories

Before diving into the code, you need to make sure that your directory structure is in place. It’s essential to know exactly where your files will be stored and accessed.

```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to the directory on your computer where your encrypted file is located.
## Step 2: Prepare Your Encrypted File

In this step, ensure that you have an encrypted Excel file available in your specified directory. Here, we will assume the file is named `encryptedBook1.out.tmp`.

```csharp
var filename = sourceDir + "encryptedBook1.out.tmp";
```
## Step 3: Open the File as a Stream 

To work with files in C#, you often need to open them as a stream. This allows you to read the file’s contents without loading the entire file into memory, which is efficient and speedy.

```csharp
Stream stream = File.Open(filename, FileMode.Open);
```
## Step 4: Detect the File Format

Now comes the magic part! Using the `FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat` method allows you to check the file format. The method also requires the password if the file is encrypted, so make sure to input that correctly.

```csharp
FileFormatInfo fileFormatInfo = FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat(stream, "1234"); // The password is 1234
```
## Step 5: Output the File Format

Finally, let’s output the file format to the console. This will give you a clear response on what format your encrypted file is.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("File Format: " + fileFormatInfo.FileFormatType);
```

## Conclusion
Detecting the file format of encrypted Excel files can be a breeze with Aspose.Cells. By following these simple steps, you can quickly ascertain the format, saving you time and potential headaches in the future. Whether you’re developing an application or just need a quick method to check file formats, this guide should set you on the right path.
