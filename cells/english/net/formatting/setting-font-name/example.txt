//ExStep:0-
// Set the path to the documents directory
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Check if the directory exists
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
// If it does not exist
if (!IsExists)
	// Create the directory
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:2-
// Instantiate a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//ExStep:3-
// Add a new worksheet to the workbook
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();

//ExStep:4-
// Obtain reference to the newly added worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];

//ExStep:5-
// Access the "A1" cell in the worksheet
Aspose.Cells.Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
// Add a value to the "A1" cell
cell.PutValue("Hello Aspose!");

//ExStep:6-
// Obtain the style of the cell
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
// Set the font name to "Times New Roman"
style.Font.Name = "Times New Roman";
// Apply the modified style to the cell
cell.SetStyle(style);

//ExStep:7-
// Save the workbook to the specified directory
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
