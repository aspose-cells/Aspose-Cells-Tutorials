//ExStart
//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to create an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells, add custom styles to cells, and save the workbook in Excel 97-2003 format.
//ExStepSummary:0: The following code initializes the directory where the Excel file is located.
//ExStepSummary:1: The following code sets up the path for the document directory and creates it if it doesn't exist.
//ExStepSummary:2: The following code instantiates a Workbook object and adds a new worksheet to the Workbook object.
//ExStepSummary:3: The following code retrieves the A1 cell style and applies a yellow foreground color with a vertical stripe pattern.
//ExStepSummary:4: The following code retrieves the A2 cell style and applies a blue foreground color, yellow background color, and a vertical stripe pattern.
//ExStepSummary:5: The following code saves the workbook in Excel 97-2003 format.

//ExStep:0-
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Check if the directory exists.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
	// Create directory if it is not already present.
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:2-
// Instantiating a Workbook object.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

// Create a new worksheet and get its index.
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();

//ExStep:3-
// Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index.
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];
// Define a Style and get the A1 cell style.
Style style = worksheet.Cells["A1"].GetStyle();

// Set cell A1 style properties
// Setting the foreground color to yellow.
style.ForegroundColor = Color.Yellow;
// Setting the background pattern to vertical stripe.
style.Pattern = BackgroundType.VerticalStripe;
// Apply the style to A1 cell.
worksheet.Cells["A1"].SetStyle(style);

//ExStep:4-
// Get the A2 cell style.
style = worksheet.Cells["A2"].GetStyle();

// Set cell A2 style properties
// Setting the foreground color to blue.
style.ForegroundColor = Color.Blue;
// Setting the background color to yellow.
style.BackgroundColor = Color.Yellow;
// Setting the background pattern to vertical stripe.
style.Pattern = BackgroundType.VerticalStripe;
// Apply the style to A2 cell.
worksheet.Cells["A2"].SetStyle(style);

//ExStep:5-
// Saving the Excel file.
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
