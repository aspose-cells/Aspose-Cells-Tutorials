//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to create an Excel file using Aspose.Cells. It initializes a workbook, adds a worksheet, populates a cell with text, modifies the cell's font size, and saves the workbook to a specified directory.
//ExStepSummary:0: This step shows how to define the path to the documents directory.
//ExStepSummary:1: This step shows how to create a directory if it does not already exist.
//ExStepSummary:2: This step demonstrates the instantiation of a Workbook object.
//ExStepSummary:3: This step indicates how to add a new worksheet to the workbook and obtain it by index.
//ExStepSummary:4: This step details how to access a specific cell and populate it with a value.
//ExStepSummary:5: This step explains how to obtain the style of the cell and modify the font size and shows how to apply the modified style to the cell.
//ExStepSummary:6: This step illustrates how to save the workbook to a specified file path.

//ExStep:0-
// Define the path to the documents directory
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Check if the directory exists
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
// If it doesn't exist
if (!IsExists)
	// Create the directory
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:2-
// Instantiate a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//ExStep:3-
// Add a new worksheet to the workbook
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();
// Get the reference of the newly added worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];

//ExStep:4-
// Access the "A1" cell from the worksheet
Aspose.Cells.Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
// Populate the "A1" cell with a value
cell.PutValue("Hello Aspose!");

//ExStep:5-
// Obtain the cell's style
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
// Set the font size to 14
style.Font.Size = 14;
// Apply the modified style to the cell
cell.SetStyle(style);

//ExStep:6-
// Save the workbook to the specified file path
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
