## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the code into manageable parts to understand how you can set significant digits and create or access worksheets in Excel using Aspose.Cells.

### Setting Significant Digits in an Excel File

This feature ensures that your numerical data is stored with a specified number of significant figures, mimicking MS-Excelâ€™s behavior.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

1. **Initialize CellsHelper**: Set the global precision for numeric values.
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Cells;

   // Set the number of significant digits globally
   CellsHelper.SignificantDigits = 15;
   ```

2. **Create a Workbook Instance**:
   ```csharp
   // Create an instance of Workbook class
   Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
   ```

3. **Access and Manipulate Worksheet**:
   Access the first worksheet and modify cell A1 to demonstrate significant digits.
   ```csharp
   // Access first worksheet
   Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

   // Access cell A1 and set a double value with 15 significant digits
   Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
   cell.PutValue(1234567890.123451711);
   ```

4. **Save the Workbook**:
   Define your output directory and save the workbook.
   ```csharp
   string temp_outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   workbook.Save(temp_outputDir + "/outputNumberOfSignificantDigits.xlsx");
   ```

### Create and Access Worksheet

Creating a new workbook or accessing an existing worksheet is straightforward with Aspose.Cells.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

1. **Create a New Workbook**:
   ```csharp
   // Instantiate a new Workbook object
   Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
   ```

2. **Access the First Worksheet**:
   ```csharp
   // Access the first worksheet from the collection
   Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
   ```

3. **Save Your Changes (Optional)**:
   Save your modifications if needed.
   ```csharp
   string temp_outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   workbook.Save(temp_outputDir + "/exampleWorkbook.xlsx");
   ```

## Practical Applications

- **Financial Reporting**: Ensure precise financial calculations by controlling significant digits in spreadsheets.
- **Scientific Data Analysis**: Maintain data integrity for scientific research by specifying exact precision levels.
- **Inventory Management**: Avoid discrepancies in stock records through consistent numeric representation.

Integration with other systems, like databases or web services, can enhance these use cases further, enabling automated report generation and data validation processes.
