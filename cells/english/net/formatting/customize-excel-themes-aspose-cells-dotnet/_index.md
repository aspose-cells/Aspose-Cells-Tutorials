### Customizing Themes in Excel

#### Overview
Customizing themes involves defining a set of colors applied throughout your document, enhancing data engagement and branding alignment.

**1. Set Up Your Environment**
Ensure the Aspose.Cells library is installed and integrate this code into your project.

Define an array of `Color` objects for theme customization:
```csharp
using System.Drawing;
// Define Color array (of 12 colors) for Theme.
Color[] carr = new Color[12];
carr[0] = Color.AntiqueWhite; // Background1
...
carr[11]= Color.Gray;         // Followed Hyperlink
```

**3. Load an Excel File**
Open or create a new workbook:
```csharp
string dataDir = "your/directory/path/";
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "book1.xlsx");
```

**4. Apply the Custom Theme**
Set custom theme colors:
```csharp
workbook.CustomTheme("CustomTheme1", carr);
```

**5. Save the Modified Excel File**
Save changes to a new file:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.out.xlsx");
```
