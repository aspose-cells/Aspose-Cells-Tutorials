## Implementation Guide

We'll cover key features for customizing number formats using Aspose.Cells.

### Adding Custom Date Format
**Overview**: Learn to format dates in Excel cells with a custom style.
1. **Create or Access a Worksheet**
   ```csharp
   int sheetIndex = workbook.Worksheets.Add();
   Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[sheetIndex];
   ```
2. **Set Current System Date with Custom Format**
   Add the current date to cell "A1" and apply a custom display format.
   ```csharp
   // Insert current system date into A1
   worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(DateTime.Now);

   // Retrieve style object for customization
   Style style = worksheet.Cells["A1"].GetStyle();

   // Set the custom number format to "d-mmm-yy"
   style.Custom = "d-mmm-yy";

   // Apply the customized style back to cell A1
   worksheet.Cells["A1"].SetStyle(style);
   ```

### Formatting Numeric Values as Percentage
**Overview**: Display numeric values in percentage format.
1. **Insert and Format Value**
   ```csharp
   // Add a numeric value to cell A2
   worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(20);

   // Fetch the style for formatting
   Style style = worksheet.Cells["A2"].GetStyle();

   // Apply custom number format as percentage
   style.Custom = "0.0%";

   // Set the formatted style back to cell A2
   worksheet.Cells["A2"].SetStyle(style);
   ```

### Applying Currency Format
**Overview**: Show numbers in currency format, with specific formatting for negative values.
1. **Insert and Style Currency Value**
   ```csharp
   // Add a value to cell A3
   worksheet.Cells["A3"].PutValue(2546);

   // Access the style object
   Style style = worksheet.Cells["A3"].GetStyle();

   // Set custom currency format
   style.Custom = "\u00a3#,##0;[Red]$-#,##0";

   // Apply to cell A3
   worksheet.Cells["A3"].SetStyle(style);
   ```

## Practical Applications

Custom number formatting is invaluable in scenarios like:
1. **Financial Reports**: Formatting currency values for clarity.
2. **Sales Dashboards**: Displaying sales figures as percentages to highlight performance metrics.
3. **Event Planning**: Using date formats to organize and present event schedules seamlessly.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large datasets, optimize Aspose.Cells' performance:
- Minimize memory usage by disposing of objects promptly using `GC.Collect()` after saving files.
- Utilize streams for reading/writing Excel files instead of loading entire documents into memory.
- Implement best practices in .NET memory management to maintain efficiency.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you've learned how to implement custom number formats in your .NET applications using Aspose.Cells. This capability enhances data presentation and ensures accuracy and visual appeal in reports and spreadsheets.

**Next Steps**: Experiment with other formatting options available within Aspose.Cells, such as conditional formatting or chart enhancements.
