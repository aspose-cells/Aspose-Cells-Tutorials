### Adding Borders to Cells
#### Overview
This section explains how to style and apply thick black borders around the "A1" cell in an Excel worksheet. This operation enhances visual clarity and organization within spreadsheets.
##### Step 1: Setting Up Your Workbook
Start by creating a workbook and accessing its first sheet:
```csharp
// Create a new workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

// Access the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```
##### Step 2: Accessing and Styling the Cell
Access cell "A1" and prepare to style it with borders:
```csharp
// Access cell A1
Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];

// Add some text for demonstration
cell.PutValue("Visit Aspose!");
```
##### Step 3: Creating and Applying Border Styles
Create a new `Style` object, configure the border properties, and apply them to your target cell:
```csharp
// Create a style object
Style style = cell.GetStyle();

// Configure top border
style.Borders[BorderType.TopBorder].LineStyle = CellBorderType.Thick;
style.Borders[BorderType.TopBorder].Color = Color.Black;

// Configure bottom border
style.Borders[BorderType.BottomBorder].LineStyle = CellBorderType.Thick;
style.Borders[BorderType.BottomBorder].Color = Color.Black;

// Configure left border
style.Borders[BorderType.LeftBorder].LineStyle = CellBorderType.Thick;
style.Borders[BorderType.LeftBorder].Color = Color.Black;

// Configure right border
style.Borders[BorderType.RightBorder].LineStyle = CellBorderType.Thick;
style.Borders[BorderType.RightBorder].Color = Color.Black;

// Apply the style to cell A1
cell.SetStyle(style);
```
##### Step 4: Saving Your Workbook
Finally, save your modifications to an Excel file:
```csharp
// Save the workbook to a specified path
string dataDir = "your_directory_path";
workbook.Save(dataDir + "StyledWorkbook.xls");
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Aspose.Cells DLL**: Ensure the package is correctly installed via NuGet.
