## Implementation Guide (H2)
Now, let's format a pivot table using Aspose.Cells in C#:

### Step 1: Load the Workbook
Begin by loading an existing Excel workbook containing your pivot table.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Path to your directory";
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(dataDir + "Book1.xls");
```

### Step 2: Access the Pivot Table
Retrieve the worksheet and locate the first pivot table:
```csharp
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
PivotTable pivot = worksheet.PivotTables[0];
```

### Step 3: Apply a Style to the Pivot Table
Define and apply a custom style for formatting:
```csharp
// Set a predefined style type
pivot.PivotTableStyleType = PivotTableStyleType.PivotTableStyleDark1;

// Create and configure a new style
Style style = workbook.CreateStyle();
style.Font.Name = "Arial Black";
style.ForegroundColor = Color.Yellow;
style.Pattern = BackgroundType.Solid;

// Apply the style to all elements of the pivot table
pivot.FormatAll(style);
```
**Explanation:** This snippet sets a dark style theme for your pivot table and applies a custom font with a yellow background, enhancing its visual impact.

### Step 4: Save the Changes
Don't forget to save your changes to the workbook:
```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```
