## Implementation Guide
This section will walk you through setting font sizes and managing directories using Aspose.Cells for .NET.
### Setting Font Size in a Cell (H2)
#### Overview:
Customizing text appearance by setting specific font sizes within an Excel cell can enhance clarity. Here's how to achieve this with Aspose.Cells for .NET.
##### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Start by declaring the source and output directories.
```csharp
string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Instantiate a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```
##### Step 2: Add a Worksheet and Access Cells
Add a new worksheet to your workbook and access the desired cell.
```csharp
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];
Aspose.Cells.Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
cell.PutValue("Hello Aspose!");
```
##### Step 3: Set Font Size
Obtain the style of the cell, modify the font size, and apply it back.
```csharp
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
style.Font.Size = 14; // Set your desired font size here
cell.SetStyle(style);
```
##### Step 4: Save Your Workbook
Finally, save your workbook to observe changes.
```csharp
workbook.Save(outputDir + "SetFontSizeExample.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
```
### Creating and Managing Directories (H2)
#### Overview:
Managing directories is crucial for organizing files. This feature ensures that necessary directories exist in your project.
##### Step 1: Check Directory Existence
Check if a directory exists; if not, create it.
```csharp
string dataDir = SourceDir + "/DataDirectory";

bool IsExists = Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
