//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to create an Excel file using Aspose.Cells, 
// while performing several actions such as directory creation, cell manipulation, 
// and saving the workbook in a specified format.

//ExStepSummary:0: Define the path for the document directory and check if it exists.
//ExStepSummary:1: Create a new directory if it doesn't exist.
//ExStepSummary:2: Instantiate a Workbook object to represent the Excel file.
//ExStepSummary:3: Obtain the reference to the first worksheet in the workbook.
//ExStepSummary:4: Access the "A1" cell and add a value to it.
//ExStepSummary:5: Merge the first three columns in the first row into a single cell.
//ExStepSummary:6: Save the workbook in the desired format and location.

//ExStep:0-
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Check if the directory exists.
bool isExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!isExists)
	// Create the directory if it does not exist.
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:2-
// Instantiate a Workbook object for the Excel file.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//ExStep:3-
// Obtain the reference to the first worksheet in the workbook.
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//ExStep:4-
// Access the "A1" cell from the worksheet.
Aspose.Cells.Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
// Add some value to the "A1" cell.
cell.PutValue("Visit Aspose!");

//ExStep:5-
// Merge the first three columns in the first row to create a single cell.
worksheet.Cells.Merge(0, 0, 1, 3);

//ExStep:6-
// Save the Excel file in the specified format.
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
