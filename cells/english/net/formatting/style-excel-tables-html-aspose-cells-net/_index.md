cell.PutValue("This is some text.");

// Style the cell - change font color to Red
Style st = cell.GetStyle();
st.Font.Color = Color.Red;
cell.SetStyle(st);
```
### Saving as HTML with Custom CSS
Use `HtmlSaveOptions` to specify custom styles:
```csharp
// Configure HtmlSaveOptions and specify table CSS id
HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
opts.TableCssId = "MyTest_TableCssId";
