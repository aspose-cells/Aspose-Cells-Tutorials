//ExStep:0-
// Define the path to the documents directory
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Check if the directory exists
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
// If it does not exist then create it
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:2-
// Instantiate a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//ExStep:3-
// Obtain a reference to the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//ExStep:4-
// Access the "A1" cell from the worksheet
Aspose.Cells.Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];

//ExStep:5-
// Add some value to the "A1" cell
cell.PutValue("Visit Aspose!");

//ExStep:6-
// Get the current style of the cell
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
// Enable text wrapping within the cell
style.IsTextWrapped = true;
// Apply the modified style back to the cell
cell.SetStyle(style);

//ExStep:7-
// Save the Excel file in the specified format
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
//ExEnd
