//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to create an Excel file using Aspose.Cells, including setting up a workbook, modifying a cell, and saving the file to a specified directory.
//ExStepSummary:0: The following code initializes the directory where the Excel file is located.
//ExStepSummary:1: The following code sets the path for the documents directory and creates it if it doesn't exist.
//ExStepSummary:2: This step initializes a Workbook object for the Excel file.
//ExStepSummary:3: This step retrieves the first worksheet from the workbook.
//ExStepSummary:4: In this step, we access the "A1" cell from the worksheet and add a value to it.
//ExStepSummary:5: This step sets the horizontal alignment of the text in the "A1" cell to center.
//ExStepSummary:6: Finally, the code saves the workbook to the specified directory in the Excel 97-2003 format.

//ExStep:0-
// Define the path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Check if the directory exists.
bool isExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!isExists) // If it does not exist,
	// create the directory.
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:2-
// Instantiate a Workbook object to create a new Excel file.
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//ExStep:3-
// Obtain a reference to the first worksheet.
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//ExStep:4-
// Access the "A1" cell from the worksheet.
Aspose.Cells.Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
// Add some value to the "A1" cell.
cell.PutValue("Visit Aspose!");

//ExStep:5-
// Get the cell's existing style.
Style style = cell.GetStyle();
// Set the horizontal alignment to center.
style.HorizontalAlignment = TextAlignmentType.Center;
// Apply the updated style to the cell.
cell.SetStyle(style);

//ExStep:6-
// Save the workbook to the specified directory in Excel 97-2003 format.
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);
