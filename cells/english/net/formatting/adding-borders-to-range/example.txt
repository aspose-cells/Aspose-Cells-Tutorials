//ExSummary: This code demonstrates how to create and format an Excel workbook using Aspose. It includes the creation of a workbook, adding a Cell value, defining a range, and applying borders to that range.
//ExStepSummary:0: This code initializes the document directory for saving the workbook.
//ExStepSummary:1: This code create a new directory if it doesn't exist.
//ExStepSummary:2: This code creates a Workbook object that represents an Excel workbook.
//ExStepSummary:3: This code accesses the first worksheet of the workbook.
//ExStepSummary:4: This code accesses the "A1" cell to input a value.
//ExStepSummary:5: This code applies thick borders to the defined range in various directions.
//ExStepSummary:6: This code saves the workbook to the specified file path.

//ExStep:0-
// Define path for the document directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

//ExStep:1-
// Check if the directory exists
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
// If directory doesn't exist
if (!IsExists)
	// Create the directory
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:2-
// Instantiate a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//ExStep:3-
// Obtain reference to the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//ExStep:4-
// Access the "A1" cell in the worksheet
Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
// Add a value to the "A1" cell
cell.PutValue("Hello World From Aspose");

//ExStep:5-
// Create a range from "A1" to the 3rd column
Range range = worksheet.Cells.CreateRange(0, 0, 1, 3);
// Apply various border styles to the range
// Set top border
range.SetOutlineBorder(BorderType.TopBorder, CellBorderType.Thick, Color.Blue);
// Set bottom border
range.SetOutlineBorder(BorderType.BottomBorder, CellBorderType.Thick, Color.Blue);
// Set left border
range.SetOutlineBorder(BorderType.LeftBorder, CellBorderType.Thick, Color.Blue);
// Set right border
range.SetOutlineBorder(BorderType.RightBorder, CellBorderType.Thick, Color.Blue);

//ExStep:6-
// Save the Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "book1.out.xls");
//ExEnd
