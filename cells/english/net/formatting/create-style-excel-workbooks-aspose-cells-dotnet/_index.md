## Implementation Guide
In this section, we will walk through the implementation of creating and styling Excel workbooks using Aspose.Cells.

### Feature: Workbook Creation and Saving
**Overview**
This feature demonstrates how to create a new Excel workbook, apply styles, auto-fit rows/columns, and save in different formats.

#### Step 1: Create a New Workbook

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Cells;

public class FeatureWorkbookCreation
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
        string output1Path = SourceDir + "Output.xlsx";
        string output2Path = SourceDir + "Output.out.ods";

        // Create a new workbook instance
        Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
```

#### Step 2: Access and Style the First Worksheet

```csharp
        // Access the first worksheet in the workbook
        Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

        // Apply built-in 'Title' style to cell A1
        Style style = workbook.CreateBuiltinStyle(BuiltinStyleType.Title);
        Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
        cell.PutValue("Aspose");
        cell.SetStyle(style);

        // Auto-fit the first column and row
        worksheet.AutoFitColumn(0);
        worksheet.AutoFitRow(0);
```

#### Step 3: Save in Multiple Formats

```csharp
        // Save as Excel format (.xlsx)
        workbook.Save(output1Path);

        // Save as OpenDocument Spreadsheet format (.ods)
        workbook.Save(output2Path);
    }
}
```

### Feature: Cell Styling with Built-in Styles
**Overview**
Learn how to apply built-in styles, enhancing the visual appeal of your cells.

#### Step 1: Create and Apply a Style

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

public class FeatureCellStyling
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";

        Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
        Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

        // Create built-in 'Title' style and apply it to cell A1
        Style style = workbook.CreateBuiltinStyle(BuiltinStyleType.Title);
        Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["A1"];
        cell.PutValue("Aspose");
        cell.SetStyle(style);
    }
}
```

### Feature: Auto-fitting Rows and Columns
**Overview**
This feature showcases how to adjust row heights and column widths automatically for better readability.

#### Step 1: Auto-fit the First Row and Column

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

public class FeatureAutoFitRowsAndColumns
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        string SourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";

        Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
        Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

        // Automatically adjust the first column's width and row's height
        worksheet.AutoFitColumn(0);
        worksheet.AutoFitRow(0);
    }
}
```

## Practical Applications
