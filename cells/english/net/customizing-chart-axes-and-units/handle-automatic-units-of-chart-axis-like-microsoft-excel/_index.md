# Handle Automatic Units of Chart Axis like Microsoft Excel

## Introduction

When it comes to manipulating Excel files, Aspose.Cells for .NET stands out as a robust library that simplifies the process of automating Excel-related tasks. Whether you’re generating reports, creating charts, or managing complex spreadsheets, this library is your go-to tool. In this tutorial, we will explore how to handle automatic units of a chart axis, just like you would in Microsoft Excel. So, grab your coding gear because we’re about to dive deep into the world of Aspose.Cells!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the tutorial, let’s ensure you have everything required to follow along:

1. Visual Studio Installed: You’ll need an IDE like Visual Studio to write and execute your .NET code.
2. .NET Framework: This tutorial assumes you're using .NET Framework 4.0 or later. However, Aspose.Cells is compatible with .NET Core as well.
3. Aspose.Cells Library: If you haven’t done this already, download the library from the Aspose website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/). You can also start with a free trial available [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).
4. Sample Excel File: We will be using a sample Excel file named `sampleHandleAutomaticUnitsOfChartAxisLikeMicrosoftExcel.xlsx`. Ensure that you have this file ready in your working directory.

## Import Packages

First things first, let's make sure you have the appropriate namespaces imported for your project. Here’s how to start:

### Create a New Project

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Click on “Create a new project”.
3. Choose “Console App (.NET Framework)” and click “Next”.
4. Name your project and click “Create”.

### Add the Aspose.Cells Reference

To use Aspose.Cells, you need to add a reference to the library.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click on “References”.
2. Choose “Add Reference”.
3. Browse to the folder where you downloaded Aspose.Cells and select `Aspose.Cells.dll`.

### Import the Required Namespaces

At the top of your `Program.cs` file, add the following namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;

using Aspose.Cells;
using Aspose.Cells.Charts;
```

Now you're all set up to start manipulating our Excel file!

## Load the Sample Excel File

### Step 1: Initialize Your Directories

Before we load the Excel file, let’s set up the output and source directories. This will allow us to specify where our files are stored.

```csharp
// Output directory - where the PDF will be saved
string outputDir = "Your Output Directory"; // specify your output directory here

// Source directory - where the sample Excel file is located
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory"; // specify your source directory here
```

### Step 2: Load the Excel File

Using Aspose.Cells, loading an Excel file is straightforward. Here’s how you do it:

```csharp
// Load the sample Excel file
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleHandleAutomaticUnitsOfChartAxisLikeMicrosoftExcel.xlsx");
```

By now, you’ve loaded your workbook with ease!

## Access and Manipulate the Chart

### Step 3: Access the First Worksheet

Next, we will access the first worksheet where our chart is located. 

```csharp
// Access the first worksheet
Worksheet ws = wb.Worksheets[0];
```

### Step 4: Access the Chart

Now it’s time to access the first chart in your worksheet with this simple line of code:

```csharp
// Access the first chart
Chart ch = ws.Charts[0];
```

### Step 5: Handle Automatic Units

In Excel, one of the key features in charts is handling automatic units for chart axes, which helps in keeping the visuals clean and understandable. Luckily, Aspose.Cells lets you modify these properties easily.

To manipulate the axis, you may need to access the `Axis` of your chart and set the `MajorUnit`:

```csharp
// Set major unit for the Y-axis
ch.AxisY.MajorUnit = 10; // You can set according to your requirement
```

Let’s update the automatic units now!

## Render the Chart to PDF

### Step 6: Export the Chart to PDF

The final and exciting step is now to render the chart into a PDF file. This is where Aspose.Cells shines because you can effortlessly export your charts in different formats.

```csharp
// Render chart to pdf
ch.ToPdf(outputDir + "outputHandleAutomaticUnitsOfChartAxisLikeMicrosoftExcel.pdf");
```

### Step 7: Execute the Program

Make sure everything is set up correctly, and then run your application. You should see a message that says:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("HandleAutomaticUnitsOfChartAxisLikeMicrosoftExcel executed successfully.");
```

## Conclusion

Working with Aspose.Cells for .NET is not only efficient but also incredibly rewarding. You can manipulate Excel files as if you’re formatting them in Excel itself! In this tutorial, we successfully loaded an Excel file, accessed and modified a chart, and rendered it to PDF, all while handling the automatic units of the chart axis. I hope you enjoyed this journey into the world of Excel automation.
