# Applying Conditional Formatting at Runtime in Excel

## Introduction

they’re powerful tools for data analysis and visualization. One of the standout features of Excel is conditional formatting, which allows users to apply specific formatting styles to cells based on their values. This can make it easier to identify trends, highlight important data points, or simply make data more readable. If you’re looking to implement conditional formatting in your Excel files programmatically, you’re in the right place! In this guide, we’ll walk through how to apply conditional formatting at runtime using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

## Prerequisites
Before diving into the code, let’s make sure you have everything you need to get started:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure that you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. You can use any version that supports .NET development.
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You’ll need to have Aspose.Cells for .NET installed. You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.
4. .NET Framework: Ensure that your project is targeting a compatible version of the .NET Framework.

Now that we have the prerequisites covered, let’s jump into the fun part!

## Import Packages
To get started with Aspose.Cells, you’ll need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# project. Here’s how you can do that:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
```

These namespaces will give you access to the classes and methods required for manipulating Excel files and applying conditional formatting.

Now, let’s break down the process of applying conditional formatting into manageable steps.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
First things first, you need to create a new C# project in Visual Studio. Here’s how:

1. Open Visual Studio and select File > New > Project.
2. Choose Console App (.NET Framework) and give your project a name.
3. Click Create.

## Step 2 : Add Aspose.Cells Reference
Once your project is set up, you need to add a reference to the Aspose.Cells library:

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select Manage NuGet Packages.
3. Search for Aspose.Cells and install it.

This will allow you to use all the functionality provided by the Aspose.Cells library.

## Step 3: Create a Workbook Object
Next, let’s create a new workbook and a worksheet. This is where all the magic happens:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string filePath = dataDir + "Book1.xlsx";

// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

In this step, we’re defining the directory where our Excel file will be saved, creating a new workbook, and accessing the first worksheet.

## Step 4: Add Conditional Formatting
Now, let’s add some conditional formatting. We’ll start by creating an empty conditional formatting object:

```csharp
// Adds an empty conditional formatting
int index = sheet.ConditionalFormattings.Add();
FormatConditionCollection fcs = sheet.ConditionalFormattings[index];
```

Here, we’re adding a new conditional formatting collection to our worksheet, which will hold our formatting rules.

## Step 5: Define the Format Range
Next, we need to specify the range of cells to which the conditional formatting will apply. Let’s say we want to format the first row and the second column:

```csharp
// Sets the conditional format range.
CellArea ca = new CellArea();
ca.StartRow =0;
ca.EndRow =0;
ca.StartColumn =0;
ca.EndColumn =0;
fcs.AddArea(ca);

ca = new CellArea();
ca.StartRow =1;
ca.EndRow =1;
ca.StartColumn =1;
ca.EndColumn =1;
fcs.AddArea(ca);
```

In this code, we define two areas for conditional formatting. The first area is for the cell at (0,0) and the second for (1,1). Feel free to adjust these ranges based on your specific needs!

## Step 6: Add Conditional Formatting Conditions
Now it’s time to define the conditions for our formatting. Let’s say we want to highlight cells based on their values:

```csharp
// Adds condition.
int conditionIndex = fcs.AddCondition(FormatConditionType.CellValue, OperatorType.Between, "=A2", "100");

// Adds condition.
int conditionIndex2 = fcs.AddCondition(FormatConditionType.CellValue, OperatorType.Between, "50", "100");
```

In this step, we’re adding two conditions: one for values between `A2` and `100`, and another for values between `50` and `100`. This allows you to dynamically highlight cells based on their values.

## Step 7: Set Formatting Styles
With our conditions in place, we can now set the formatting styles. Let's change the background color for our conditions:

```csharp
// Sets the background color.
FormatCondition fc = fcs[conditionIndex];
fc.Style.BackgroundColor = Color.Red;
```

Here, we’re setting the background color of the first condition to red. You can customize this further by changing the font color, borders, and other styles as needed!

## Step 8: Save the Excel File
Finally, it’s time to save our work! We’ll save the workbook to the specified directory:

```csharp
// Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xls");
```

This line of code saves the Excel file with the conditional formatting applied. Make sure to check the specified directory for your output file!

## Conclusion
And there you have it! You’ve successfully applied conditional formatting at runtime in Excel using Aspose.Cells for .NET. This powerful library makes it easy to manipulate Excel files programmatically, allowing you to automate tedious tasks and enhance your data presentations. Whether you’re working on a small project or a large-scale application, Aspose.Cells can help you streamline your workflow and improve your productivity.
