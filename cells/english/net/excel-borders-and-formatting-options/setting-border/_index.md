# Setting Border Programmatically in Excel

## Introduction

Are you tired of manually setting borders in your Excel sheets? You’re not alone! Setting borders can be a tedious task, especially when you're dealing with large datasets. But fear not! With Aspose.Cells for .NET, you can automate this process, saving you time and effort. In this tutorial, we'll dive into the nitty-gritty of programmatically setting borders in an Excel workbook. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, you'll find this guide easy to follow and packed with helpful insights.

So, are you ready to level up your Excel automation skills? Let’s jump in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio: You should have Visual Studio installed on your machine. If you don’t, download it from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. Aspose.Cells for .NET: You need to have the Aspose.Cells library. You can get it by downloading the DLL from [this link](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) or by using NuGet in your project:
```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```
3. Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code better.
4. A Development Environment: Set up a console application or any project type where you can run C# code.

Once you’ve got everything set up, we can move on to the fun part: coding!

## Import Packages

Now that we have everything in place, let’s import the necessary namespaces in our C# file. At the top of your code file, add the following:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
using System.Drawing;
```

These namespaces give you access to the functionalities of Aspose.Cells and the color functionalities from the System.Drawing namespace.

## Step 1: Define Your Document Directory

First things first, we need to specify where our Excel file will be saved. Define the path to your documents directory:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path where you want to save your Excel file. 

## Step 2: Create a Workbook Object

Next, let’s create an instance of the `Workbook` class. This will represent our Excel workbook.

```csharp
// Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

Here, we’re also accessing the first worksheet in our workbook. Easy peasy!

## Step 3: Add Conditional Formatting

Now we’ll add some conditional formatting. This allows us to specify which cells will have borders based on certain conditions. 

```csharp
// Adds an empty conditional formatting
int index = sheet.ConditionalFormattings.Add();
FormatConditionCollection fcs = sheet.ConditionalFormattings[index];
```

## Step 4: Set the Conditional Format Range

Let’s define the range of cells that we want to apply the conditional formatting to. In this case, we’re working with a range that covers rows 0 to 5 and columns 0 to 3:

```csharp
// Sets the conditional format range.
CellArea ca = new CellArea();
ca.StartRow = 0;
ca.EndRow = 5;
ca.StartColumn = 0;
ca.EndColumn = 3;
fcs.AddArea(ca);
```

## Step 5: Add a Condition

Now, we’ll add a condition to our formatting. In this example, we'll apply the formatting to cells that contain values between 50 and 100:

```csharp
// Adds condition.
int conditionIndex = fcs.AddCondition(FormatConditionType.CellValue, OperatorType.Between, "50", "100");
```

## Step 6: Customize Border Styles

With our condition set, we can now customize the border styles. Here’s how we can set all four borders to be dashed:

```csharp
// Sets the background color.
FormatCondition fc = fcs[conditionIndex];
fc.Style.Borders[BorderType.LeftBorder].LineStyle = CellBorderType.Dashed;
fc.Style.Borders[BorderType.RightBorder].LineStyle = CellBorderType.Dashed;
fc.Style.Borders[BorderType.TopBorder].LineStyle = CellBorderType.Dashed;
fc.Style.Borders[BorderType.BottomBorder].LineStyle = CellBorderType.Dashed;
```

## Step 7: Set Border Colors

We can also set the colors for each border. Let’s assign a cyan color to the left, right, and top borders, and a yellow color to the bottom border:

```csharp
fc.Style.Borders[BorderType.LeftBorder].Color = Color.FromArgb(0, 255, 255);
fc.Style.Borders[BorderType.RightBorder].Color = Color.FromArgb(0, 255, 255);
fc.Style.Borders[BorderType.TopBorder].Color = Color.FromArgb(0, 255, 255);
fc.Style.Borders[BorderType.BottomBorder].Color = Color.FromArgb(255, 255, 0);
```

## Step 8: Save Your Workbook

Finally, let’s save our workbook. Use the following code to save the changes:

```csharp
workbook.Save(dataDir + "output.xlsx");
```

This will save your Excel file as `output.xlsx` in the specified directory. 

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You've successfully set borders programmatically in an Excel file using Aspose.Cells for .NET. By automating this process, you can save countless hours, especially when dealing with larger datasets. Imagine being able to customize your reports without lifting a finger—now that’s efficiency.
