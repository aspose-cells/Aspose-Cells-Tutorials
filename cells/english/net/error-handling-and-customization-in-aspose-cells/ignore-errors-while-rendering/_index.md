# Ignore Errors in Excel to PDF Rendering with Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
When it comes to converting Excel files to PDF, encountering errors can be a nightmare, especially if you're dealing with critical data that needs to be shared or archived. But don't sweat it; Aspose.Cells for .NET is here to save the day! In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to ignore errors during the conversion process. Imagine turning a chaotic Excel sheet into a polished PDF without the hassle of interruptions. Let’s dive in!
## Prerequisites
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of converting Excel to PDF while ignoring pesky errors, you’ll need to ensure a few things are in place:
1. .NET Environment: Make sure you have .NET installed on your machine. Whether you’re using .NET Framework or .NET Core, Aspose.Cells works seamlessly.
2. Aspose.Cells Library: You need to have the Aspose.Cells library integrated into your project. If you haven’t done this yet, don’t worry; you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/).
3. Basic Understanding of C#: This tutorial will use C#, so being familiar with the language will make things smoother.
4. Sample Excel File: Get your sample Excel workbook ready for testing. You can create one that you expect to throw errors during conversion.
Now that we have everything in place, let’s get started with the coding!
## Import Packages
To begin, you’ll need to import the necessary namespaces. Aspose.Cells provides a range of functionalities, and importing these packages will help you access them easily.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
Make sure to add these lines at the top of your C# file before diving into the main logic of the conversion process.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Directories
First off, you need to define where your source Excel file is located and where you want to save the output PDF. Create variables that will store these directory paths.
```csharp
//Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
//Output directory
string outputDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Grab your directories and plug them into the code. Ensure the paths are correct; otherwise, it won’t find your files!
## Step 2: Load the Sample Workbook
Next, you’ll want to load your Excel workbook. This includes creating an instance of the `Workbook` class and passing the path of your Excel file.
```csharp
//Load the Sample Workbook that throws Error on Excel2Pdf conversion
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleErrorExcel2Pdf.xlsx");
```
This line initializes a new `Workbook` object. Be sure to replace `"sampleErrorExcel2Pdf.xlsx"` with the filename of your actual Excel document.
## Step 3: Specify Pdf Save Options
Here comes the secret sauce: configuring the `PdfSaveOptions`. By setting the `IgnoreError` property to `true`, you can seamlessly convert your Excel file without being halted by errors.
```csharp
//Specify Pdf Save Options - Ignore Error
PdfSaveOptions opts = new PdfSaveOptions();
opts.IgnoreError = true;
```
That’s it! With this configuration, your code will now politely overlook any errors during the conversion process.
## Step 4: Save the Workbook as PDF
Once you have your workbook loaded and your save options in place, it’s time to convert and save the document as a PDF. Use the `Save` method of the `Workbook` class for this.
```csharp
//Save the Workbook in Pdf with Pdf Save Options
wb.Save(outputDir + "outputErrorExcel2Pdf.pdf", opts);
```
This line will create the PDF in your specified output directory. Just remember to replace `"outputErrorExcel2Pdf.pdf"` with whatever name you fancy for your new PDF.
## Step 5: Confirm Successful Execution
Finally, after saving the PDF, it’s always a nice touch to let yourself (or future users) know the process was successful. You can achieve this simply with a console message.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("IgnoreErrorsWhileRenderingExcelToPdf executed successfully.\r\n");
```
After running this code, check your output directory! You should find your newly created PDF, error-free and ready for sharing.
## Conclusion
And voilà! You’ve successfully converted an Excel file to a PDF while ignoring any errors that popped up along the way. Aspose.Cells for .NET not only simplifies this process but allows you to work with your data efficiently without getting bogged down by issues that can frequently arise in Excel files.
By following these simple steps, you can maintain your productivity and ensure that essential documents are safely converted and ready for distribution. So, the next time you face an error in Excel during conversion, remember this approach.
