# Automate Excel OLE Object Extraction and Saving with Aspose.Cells for .NET

## Introduction

Are you looking to streamline your workflow by automating the extraction of embedded objects in your Excel files? Whether you're a developer or data analyst, leveraging **Aspose.Cells for .NET** can significantly reduce manual effort and errors. This tutorial will guide you through extracting and saving Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects from Excel workbooks based on their file formats.

### What You'll Learn:
- Opening and loading an Excel workbook using Aspose.Cells.
- Accessing the collection of OLE objects in a worksheet.
- Extracting and saving OLE objects according to their specific formats.

Let's set up your environment and implement this efficient feature!

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following prerequisites covered:

### Required Libraries:
- **Aspose.Cells for .NET** - Essential for handling Excel files in a .NET environment.

### Environment Setup:
- A development environment like Visual Studio or any compatible IDE with support for C# and .NET.

### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with the .NET framework, especially file I/O operations.

## Setting Up Aspose.Cells for .NET

To use Aspose.Cells for .NET, you need to install it in your project. Here's how:

### Installation Instructions:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Cells
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
PM> NuGet\Install-Package Aspose.Cells
```

### License Acquisition:
- **Free Trial:** Start with a 30-day free trial to explore all features.
- **Temporary License:** Request a temporary license for extended access.
- **Purchase:** Buy a full license if this tool meets your needs.

Once installed, initialize Aspose.Cells in your project like so:

```csharp
using Aspose.Cells;

// Initialize the library
Aspose.Cells.License license = new Aspose.Cells.License();
license.SetLicense("Path to License File");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Open and Load Workbook

Let's load an Excel workbook from a specified directory.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**Define Source Directory:**
```csharp
string sourceDir = "YOUR_SOURCE_DIRECTORY";
```

**Create Workbook Instance:**
```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleExtractOLEObjects.xlsx");
```
This step loads your Excel file into a `Workbook` object, allowing you to manipulate its contents programmatically.

### Feature 2: Access OleObject Collection in Worksheet

Now, access the OLE objects embedded within the first worksheet of the workbook.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**Access First Worksheet:**
```csharp
OleObjectCollection oles = workbook.Worksheets[0].OleObjects;
```
This snippet retrieves all OLE objects from the specified worksheet for further processing.

### Feature 3: Extract and Save OLE Objects Based on Format

Next, iterate through each OLE object to extract its data and save it according to its format.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**Iterate Through OLE Objects:**
```csharp
using System.IO;

for (int i = 0; i < oles.Count; i++)
{
    OleObject ole = oles[i];
    byte[] oleData = ole.ObjectData;
    string fileName = outputDir + "outputExtractOLEObjects" + (i+1) + ".";

    switch (ole.FileFormatType)
    {
        case FileFormatType.Doc:
            fileName += "doc";
            break;
        case FileFormatType.Docx:
            fileName += "docx";
            break;
        case FileFormatType.Excel97To2003:
            fileName += "xls";
            break;
        case FileFormatType.Xlsx:
            // Special handling for XLSX formats
            using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
            {
                ms.Write(ole.ObjectData, 0, ole.ObjectData.Length);
                Workbook oleBook = new Workbook(ms);
                oleBook.Settings.IsHidden = false;

                ms.SetLength(0); // Clear the stream
                oleBook.Save(ms, SaveFormat.Xlsx);

                ms.Position = 0;
                byte[] bts = new byte[ms.Length];
                ms.Read(bts, 0, (int)ms.Length);
                oleData = bts;
            }
            fileName += "xlsx";
            break;
        case FileFormatType.Ppt:
            fileName += "ppt";
            break;
        case FileFormatType.Pdf:
            fileName += "pdf";
            break;
        case FileFormatType.Unknown:
            Guid g = new Guid(ole.ClassIdentifier);
            if (g.ToString() == "b801ca65-a1fc-11d0-85ad-444553540000")
            {
                fileName += "pdf";
            }
            else
            {
                fileName += "jpg";
            }                      
            break;
        default:
            // Handle other formats or throw an exception
            break;
    }

    File.WriteAllBytes(fileName, oleData);
}
```
This section demonstrates how to dynamically handle different file formats and save them appropriately.
