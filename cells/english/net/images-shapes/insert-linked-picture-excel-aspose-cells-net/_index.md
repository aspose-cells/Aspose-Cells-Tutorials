## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to insert a linked picture into an Excel sheet using Aspose.Cells for .NET.

### Inserting a Linked Picture

#### Overview
Add images from web addresses directly into an Excel worksheet. This feature allows dynamic updates without embedding static resources.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Set Up Output Directory**
Define where your output file will be saved:

```csharp
string outputDir = RunExamples.Get_OutputDirectory();
```

**2. Initialize Workbook and Worksheet**
Create a new `Workbook` object and access the first worksheet:

```csharp
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
Worksheet sheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

**3. Add Linked Picture**
Use the `AddLinkedPicture` method to embed an image from a web URL into cell B2 (1, 1 index-based):

```csharp
Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Picture pic = sheet.Shapes.AddLinkedPicture(1, 1, 100, 100, "http://www.aspose.com/Images/aspose-logo.jpg");
```
- **Parameters Explained:**
  - `row`: Row index (0-based)
  - `column`: Column index (0-based)
  - `width`: Width of the image in points
  - `height`: Height of the image in points
  - `webAddress`: URL of the image

**4. Configure Image Dimensions**
Adjust the size using inches:

```csharp
pic.HeightInch = 1.04;
pic.WidthInch = 2.6;
```

**5. Save Workbook**
Save the workbook to a specified directory:

```csharp
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputInsertLinkedPicture.xlsx");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Broken Image Links:** Ensure your web address is correct and accessible.
- **Image Not Displaying:** Verify Aspose.Cells updates linked images correctly.

## Practical Applications

Integrating linked pictures can be beneficial in various scenarios:
1. **Dynamic Reports**: Automatically update charts or logos from a central server.
