```

## Implementation Guide

### Refreshing Linked Shapes in Excel Charts

Refreshing linked shapes involves updating data sources for charts. This section provides a detailed implementation guide.

#### Step 1: Load the Workbook
Begin by loading your Excel file containing the chart and linked shapes.

```csharp
// Source directory where the sample file is located
string sourceDir = RunExamples.Get_SourceDirectory();

// Create workbook from source file
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleRefreshValueOfLinkedShapes.xlsx");
```

#### Step 2: Access the Worksheet
Access the worksheet containing your chart.

```csharp
// Access the first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];
```

#### Step 3: Update Cell Values
Change the value of a cell linked to the shape or chart.

```csharp
// Change the value of cell B4
Cell cell = worksheet.Cells["B4"];
cell.PutValue(100);
```

#### Step 4: Refresh Linked Shapes
Update the value of the linked picture using Aspose.Cells methods.

```csharp
// Update the value of the Linked Picture linked to cell B4
worksheet.Shapes.UpdateSelectedValue();
```

#### Step 5: Save the Workbook
Save your changes and output in a different format if needed, such as PDF.

```csharp
// Output directory for saving files
string outputDir = RunExamples.Get_OutputDirectory();

// Save the workbook in PDF format
workbook.Save(outputDir + "outputRefreshValueOfLinkedShapes.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your Excel file paths are correct.
- Verify linked shapes have a clear data source.
- Check for any updates or changes in Aspose.Cells API versions.
