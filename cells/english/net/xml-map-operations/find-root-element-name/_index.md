# Find Root Element Name of Xml Map using Aspose.Cells

## Introduction
Working with Excel files that contain XML data? If so, you'll often find yourself needing to identify the root element name of an XML map embedded in your spreadsheet. Whether you're generating reports, transforming data, or managing structured information, this process is crucial for data integration. In this guide, we'll break down how to retrieve the root element name of an XML map from an Excel file using the powerful Aspose.Cells library for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- Aspose.Cells for .NET: Download the [Aspose.Cells for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/cells/net/) library if you haven't already. This library offers extensive features for manipulating Excel files programmatically.
- Microsoft Visual Studio (or any .NET-compatible IDE): You'll need this to code in C# and execute the example.
- Basic Knowledge of XML in Excel: Understanding XML mapping in Excel will help you follow along.
- A Sample Excel File: This file should have an XML map set up. You can create one manually or use an existing file with XML data.
## Import Packages
To start coding, you need to import essential packages to work with Aspose.Cells for .NET. Here’s how:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Cells;
```
These packages provide the classes and methods required to interact with Excel files and XML maps in Aspose.Cells.
In this tutorial, we'll go through each step required to load an Excel file, access its XML map, and print out the root element name.
## Step 1: Set Up the Document Directory
First, set up the directory where your Excel document is located. This will allow the program to locate and load your file. Let's call this the source directory.
```csharp
// Source directory
string sourceDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Here, `"Your Document Directory"` should be replaced with the actual path where your Excel file is saved. This line defines the folder path that the program will look into.
## Step 2: Load the Excel File
Now, let’s load the Excel file into our program. Aspose.Cells uses the `Workbook` class to represent an Excel file. In this step, we’ll load the workbook and specify the file name.
```csharp
// Load sample Excel file having XML Map
Workbook wb = new Workbook(sourceDir + "sampleRootElementNameOfXmlMap.xlsx");
```
Replace `"sampleRootElementNameOfXmlMap.xlsx"` with the name of your Excel file. This line initializes a new instance of `Workbook`, loading your Excel file into it. 
## Step 3: Access the First XML Map in the Workbook
Excel files can contain multiple XML maps, so here we’ll specifically access the first XML map. Aspose.Cells provides the `XmlMaps` property of the `Worksheet` class for this purpose.
```csharp
// Access first XML Map inside the Workbook
XmlMap xmap = wb.Worksheets.XmlMaps[0];
```
This code retrieves the first XML map from the list of XML maps associated with the workbook. By accessing the first item (`XmlMaps[0]`), you’re selecting the first XML map embedded in your file.
## Step 4: Retrieve and Print the Root Element Name
The root element name is critical because it represents the starting point of your XML structure. Let’s print out this root element name using `Console.WriteLine`.
```csharp
// Print Root Element Name of XML Map on Console
Console.WriteLine("Root Element Name Of XML Map: " + xmap.RootElementName);
```
Here, we’re using `xmap.RootElementName` to fetch the root element name and printing it to the console. You should see the output showing the name of the root element directly on your console screen.
## Step 5: Execute and Verify
Now that everything is set up, simply run your program. If all goes well, you should see the root element name of your XML map displayed in the console.
```plaintext
Root Element Name Of XML Map: [Root Element Name]
```
If you see the root element name, congratulations! You've successfully accessed and retrieved it from the XML map in your Excel file.
## Conclusion
And that’s a wrap! By following this tutorial, you’ve learned how to use Aspose.Cells for .NET to extract the root element name of an XML map within an Excel file. This can be incredibly helpful when you're working with XML data in spreadsheets, especially in situations that require seamless data handling and transformation.
## FAQ's
### What is an XML Map in Excel?
An XML map links the data in an Excel worksheet to an XML schema, enabling structured data to be imported and exported.
### Can I access multiple XML maps in an Excel file with Aspose.Cells?
Absolutely! You can access multiple XML maps using the `XmlMaps` property and iterate through them.
### Does Aspose.Cells support XML schema validation?
While Aspose.Cells doesn’t validate XML against a schema, it supports importing and working with XML maps in Excel files.
### Can I modify the root element name?
No, the root element name is determined by the XML schema and can’t be modified directly through Aspose.Cells.
### Is there a free version of Aspose.Cells for testing?
Yes, Aspose offers a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) for you to try out Aspose.Cells before purchasing a license.
